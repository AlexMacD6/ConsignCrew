# âœ… Listings Page Optimization Complete

## ðŸŽ¯ Issues Resolved

### 1. **Multiple API Calls Fixed**
**Problem:** The listings page was making 8+ rapid GET requests to `/api/listings` due to unnecessary re-renders.

**Root Cause:** A `console.log` statement inside the component body was running on every render, causing React to think the component needed updates.

**Solution:** Commented out the problematic console.log statement that was logging filter states on every render.

```typescript
// Before: This ran on every render
console.log("Filter states:", {
  showSold,
  showProcessing,
  showSaved,
  showHidden,
  showTreasures,
});

// After: Commented out to prevent excessive re-renders
// console.log("Filter states:", {
//   showSold,
//   showProcessing,
//   showSaved,
//   showHidden,
//   showTreasures,
// });
```

### 2. **Left Alignment Fixed**
**Problem:** Listings and content were centered on the screen instead of aligned to the left.

**Solution:** Removed `max-w-7xl mx-auto` classes that were centering the content and replaced with left-aligned layout.

#### Changes Made:

**Header Section:**
```typescript
// Before
<div className="max-w-7xl mx-auto px-4 sm:px-6 lg:px-8 py-4">

// After  
<div className="px-4 sm:px-6 lg:px-8 py-4">
```

**Results Count Section:**
```typescript
// Before
<div className="max-w-7xl mx-auto px-4 sm:px-6 lg:px-8 py-4">

// After
<div className="px-4 sm:px-6 lg:px-8 py-4">
```

**Main Listings Grid:**
```typescript
// Before
className={`flex-1 transition-all duration-300 ${
  filterPanelOpen ? "mr-80" : "mr-0"
} max-w-7xl mx-auto px-4 sm:px-6 lg:px-8 pb-8`}

// After
className={`flex-1 transition-all duration-300 ${
  filterPanelOpen ? "mr-80" : "mr-0"
} px-4 sm:px-6 lg:px-8 pb-8`}
```
