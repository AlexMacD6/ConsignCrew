# Inventory Disposition Refactor - Data Migration Summary

## What Happened

This refactor completely redesigned how inventory item statuses are tracked. The old system used:
- A single `receiveStatus` enum (MANIFESTED, PARTIALLY_RECEIVED, RECEIVED)
- Single disposition tracking (`disposition`, `dispositionQuantity`)

The new system uses:
- A separate `InventoryDisposition` table that allows multiple status records per item
- Three status types: RECEIVED, TRASH, USE
- Supports splitting items (e.g., 1 received, 1 trashed, 1 used)

## Data Loss During Migration

**⚠️ IMPORTANT**: When we ran `npx prisma db push --accept-data-loss`, the following data was cleared:

### Lost Fields from `InventoryItem`:
- `receiveStatus` - All items were reset (now calculated from dispositions)
- `receivedQuantity` - Lost (now calculated from disposition records)
- `receivedAt`, `receivedBy` - Lost
- `disposition`, `dispositionQuantity` - Lost (replaced by disposition records)
- `dispositionAt`, `dispositionBy`, `dispositionNotes` - Lost

### Current State (after migration):
- **289 inventory items** total
- **0 items** with disposition records (all data was cleared)
- **289 items** now show as "manifested" (not yet received)

## Going Forward

All inventory items will need to be received again through the new system:
1. Items show as "Manifested" quantity = total quantity
2. Use "Receive" button to mark items as received
3. Use "Trash" or "Use" buttons to mark items with special dispositions
4. All changes will be tracked in the `InventoryDisposition` table

## Why This Was Necessary

The old schema couldn't support:
- Splitting items into multiple statuses
- Changing statuses after initial disposition
- Clear separation between receipt and disposition

The new schema provides:
- Full flexibility to split items
- Ability to change any status at any time
- Complete audit trail of all status changes
- Simpler mental model (3 clear statuses)

## Recovery Options

If the lost data was critical:
1. **Restore from database backup** (if available)
2. **Manually re-receive items** using the new system
3. **Import from external records** if tracked elsewhere

The new system is more robust and will provide better tracking going forward.
