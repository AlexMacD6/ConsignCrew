# Inventory Receiving UI Enhancements

## Summary

Enhanced the Inventory Receiving tab with three key improvements:
1. **Always visible action buttons** - Receive, Trash, and Use buttons now always appear (not conditional)
2. **Editable notes** - Inline editing of disposition-specific notes in the table
3. **Status count updates** - Counts automatically refresh after disposition changes

## Changes Made

### 1. Always Show Action Buttons

**Before:**
- "Receive" button only showed if `manifested > 0`
- "Trash" and "Use" buttons only showed if `receivedQuantity > 0`

**After:**
- All three buttons (Receive, Trash, Use) always visible
- Buttons are disabled if `total === 0` (no items to allocate)
- Users can now change dispositions at any time (e.g., RECEIVED → TRASH)

**Code Change:**
```tsx
// Before - conditional rendering
{manifested > 0 && (
  <button onClick={() => openModal(item, "RECEIVED")}>
    Receive
  </button>
)}
{rec > 0 && (
  <button onClick={() => openModal(item, "TRASH")}>
    Trash
  </button>
)}

// After - always rendered
<button
  onClick={() => openModal(item, "RECEIVED")}
  disabled={total === 0}
>
  Receive
</button>
<button
  onClick={() => openModal(item, "TRASH")}
  disabled={total === 0}
>
  Trash
</button>
<button
  onClick={() => openModal(item, "USE")}
  disabled={total === 0}
>
  Use
</button>
```

### 2. Inline Editable Notes

**Features:**
- Click on any note cell to edit
- Each disposition row has its own independent note
- Save/Cancel buttons appear when editing
- Auto-focus on input field
- Empty notes show "Click to add note" placeholder

**New State:**
```typescript
// Notes editing state
const [editingNoteId, setEditingNoteId] = useState<string | null>(null);
const [editingNoteText, setEditingNoteText] = useState("");
```

**New Functions:**
```typescript
const startEditingNote = (row: DisplayRow) => {
  const noteId = `${row.itemId}-${row.type}`;
  setEditingNoteId(noteId);
  setEditingNoteText(row.notes || "");
};

const cancelEditingNote = () => {
  setEditingNoteId(null);
  setEditingNoteText("");
};

const saveNote = async (row: DisplayRow) => {
  // Updates the disposition with new notes via PUT /api/.../disposition
  // Refreshes items after save
};
```

**UI Implementation:**
```tsx
{/* Notes column */}
<td className="py-3 px-4">
  {editingNoteId === `${row.itemId}-${row.type}` ? (
    // Edit mode - show input + save/cancel buttons
    <div className="flex items-center gap-2">
      <input
        type="text"
        value={editingNoteText}
        onChange={(e) => setEditingNoteText(e.target.value)}
        className="flex-1 px-2 py-1 text-xs border rounded..."
        placeholder="Add note..."
        autoFocus
      />
      <button onClick={() => saveNote(row)} title="Save">
        <CheckCircle className="h-4 w-4" />
      </button>
      <button onClick={cancelEditingNote} title="Cancel">
        <X className="h-4 w-4" />
      </button>
    </div>
  ) : (
    // View mode - show note with click-to-edit
    <div
      className="text-xs text-gray-600 max-w-xs cursor-pointer hover:bg-gray-50..."
      onClick={() => startEditingNote(row)}
      title="Click to edit"
    >
      {row.notes || (
        <span className="text-gray-400 italic">
          Click to add note
        </span>
      )}
    </div>
  )}
</td>
```

### 3. Status Count Updates

**How It Works:**
- Status counts are fetched from the API in `fetchItems()`
- `fetchItems()` is called after successful disposition changes:
  - After `handleModalSubmit()` (Receive/Trash/Use actions)
  - After `saveNote()` (note updates)
- The counts update automatically on the next API response

**API Response:**
```typescript
const data = await res.json();
if (data.success) {
  setItems(data.items);
  setTotalPages(data.pagination.totalPages || 1);
  setStatusCounts(data.statusCounts); // ← Updates counts
}
```

## User Experience

### Action Buttons
**Before:**
- Confusing - buttons would disappear after changing status
- Couldn't change RECEIVED items to TRASH (button hidden)

**After:**
- Consistent - all 3 buttons always visible
- Can easily change between any status
- Clear disabled state when no items available

### Notes Editing
**Before:**
- Notes were read-only in the table
- Had to use modal to add notes

**After:**
- Click any note cell to edit
- Quick inline editing without modal
- Each disposition has its own note
- Visual feedback with hover effect

### Status Counts
**Before:**
- Counts wouldn't update after changes
- Had to manually refresh page

**After:**
- Counts update immediately after any disposition change
- Always accurate reflection of current state

## Testing Instructions

1. **Test Action Buttons:**
   - Navigate to Inventory Receiving tab
   - Verify all 3 buttons (Receive, Trash, Use) are visible for every item
   - Click Trash on a RECEIVED item - should work ✅
   - Verify buttons are disabled for items with totalQuantity = 0

2. **Test Notes Editing:**
   - Click on a note cell (shows "Click to add note" if empty)
   - Type a note and click the green checkmark to save
   - Verify note appears in the table
   - Click the note again to edit
   - Click the red X to cancel without saving
   - Verify each row (RECEIVED/TRASH/USE) has independent notes

3. **Test Status Counts:**
   - Note the current counts (Manifested: X, Received: Y, Trash: Z, Use: W)
   - Change an item from RECEIVED to TRASH
   - Verify counts update automatically:
     - Trash count should increase
     - Page should refresh with new counts
   - Try filtering by each status to verify accuracy

## Technical Notes

- Notes are saved per-disposition (not per-item), so an item with 1 RECEIVED + 1 TRASH can have 2 different notes
- The `saveNote` function reuses the existing PUT `/api/admin/inventory/items/[id]/disposition` endpoint
- The `editingNoteId` uses format `${itemId}-${dispositionType}` to uniquely identify which note is being edited
- Status counts are calculated server-side in `/api/admin/inventory/items/route.ts` and returned with every fetch
