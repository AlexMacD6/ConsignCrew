# Pick Ticket Print-Only Content Fix

## Summary
Fixed the pick ticket printing by creating a separate print-only version of the content that displays clean text (not modal screenshots) and eliminates duplication.

## Root Cause of Issues
1. **Modal Screenshots**: The print CSS was trying to print the modal itself, including background overlays and modal containers
2. **Duplication**: The modal structure was being printed multiple times due to complex CSS selectors

## Solution Approach
Created a completely separate print-only version of the pick ticket content that:
- Lives outside the modal structure
- Only renders when the modal is open
- Uses simple `print-hide` and `print-show` classes

## Changes Made

### 1. Created Print-Only Content Structure
- Added a new `pick-ticket-print-area` div outside the modal
- Only renders when `selectedOrder && showPickTicketModal` are true
- Uses the exact same `CustomQRCode` component as the modal

### 2. Clean Print CSS
Simplified the print styles in `globals.css`:
```css
@media print {
  /* Hide everything except print content */
  .print-hide {
    display: none !important;
  }

  /* Show print-only content */
  .print-show {
    display: block !important;
  }

  /* Ensure Poppins font is used */
  * {
    font-family: 'Poppins', Arial, sans-serif !important;
  }

  /* 8.5" x 11" page setup */
  @page {
    size: 8.5in 11in;
    margin: 0.5in;
  }
}
```

### 3. Updated Modal Structure
- Added `print-hide` classes to modal overlay and container
- Kept the modal functional for on-screen viewing
- The modal shows normally but prints the separate clean content

### 4. Print Content Features
- **Black TreasureHub Logo**: No colored ink needed
- **Real QR Code**: Uses the same `CustomQRCode` component
- **Clean Text Layout**: No modal styling, backgrounds, or shadows
- **Poppins Font**: Consistent with application branding
- **Single Page**: All content fits properly on 8.5" x 11"

## Files Modified
- `app/admin/delivery-scheduler/page.tsx` - Added print-only content structure
- `app/globals.css` - Simplified and cleaned up print CSS

## Benefits
- ✅ **Clean Text Output**: Prints as clean text, not modal screenshots
- ✅ **No Duplication**: Single clean print output
- ✅ **Real QR Code**: Uses the exact same CustomQRCode component
- ✅ **Black Logo**: Professional look without colored ink
- ✅ **Poppins Font**: Brand consistency
- ✅ **Proper Layout**: Fits perfectly on one 8.5" x 11" page

## How It Works
1. When modal opens, both the modal content AND print-only content are rendered
2. On screen: modal is visible, print-only content is hidden (`hidden print-show`)
3. When printing: modal is hidden (`print-hide`), print-only content becomes visible
4. Result: Clean, professional warehouse pick ticket with no duplication
