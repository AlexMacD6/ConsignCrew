# Pick Ticket Cleanup

## Summary
Cleaned up the print-only pick ticket content to be more focused and print-friendly by removing unnecessary sections and making the logo smaller.

## Changes Made

### 1. Smaller Logo
- Reduced logo height from `h-16` to `h-8` (from 4rem to 2rem)
- Reduced margin from `mr-4` to `mr-3`
- Logo is now more proportional and takes up less space

### 2. Removed Order Information Section
Removed the entire "ORDER INFORMATION" section that included:
- Order Number
- Date/Time
- Payment Status

This information is typically not needed for warehouse picking operations.

### 3. Removed Footer Content
Removed the footer that showed:
- "TreasureHub Warehouse Operations"
- Generation timestamp

This keeps the print output clean and focused on the essential picking information.

## Current Pick Ticket Content
The streamlined pick ticket now contains only the essential information:

1. **Header**: Small logo + "WAREHOUSE PICK TICKET" title
2. **Item Reference**: QR code and item ID
3. **Warehouse Instructions**: Pick/pack instructions
4. **Item to Pick**: Photo, SKU, title, quantity, condition
5. **Delivery & Contact**: Address and buyer information

## Benefits
- ✅ **Cleaner Layout**: Less clutter, more focused
- ✅ **Better Proportions**: Smaller logo looks more professional
- ✅ **Essential Info Only**: Contains exactly what warehouse staff need
- ✅ **Print Friendly**: Optimal use of page space
- ✅ **Professional Appearance**: Clean, business document format

## Files Modified
- `app/admin/delivery-scheduler/page.tsx` - Removed Order Info section, footer, and made logo smaller
