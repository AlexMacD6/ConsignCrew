# React Spring Web Dependency Addition

## Issue
- Development server failed to start due to missing `@react-spring/web` dependency
- Error: "Failed to resolve import '@react-spring/web' from 'src/components/SignupModal.jsx'"

## Solution
- Added `@react-spring/web` dependency to the project
- Used `--legacy-peer-deps` flag to resolve React version compatibility issues
- Dependency automatically added to package.json

## Changes Made
- Installed `@react-spring/web@^10.0.1` via npm
- Updated package.json to include the new dependency
- Resolved import resolution error in SignupModal.jsx

## Testing
- Development server should now start without import errors
- SignupModal component should load properly with react-spring animations

## Dependencies Added
- @react-spring/web: ^10.0.1
