Email Verification Domain Fix

Issue:
- Users receiving "invalid token" error when clicking email verification links
- Email verification links were being generated with wrong domain (treasurehub.vercel.app instead of treasurehub.club)

Root Cause:
- Hardcoded domain replacement in auth.ts was using 'https://treasurehub.vercel.app' instead of 'https://treasurehub.club'
- This caused token validation to fail because the domain in the token didn't match the actual production domain

Changes Made:
1. Updated email verification URL generation in app/lib/auth.ts
   - Changed from 'https://treasurehub.vercel.app' to 'https://treasurehub.club'
   - Fixed in sendVerificationEmail function

2. Updated password reset URL generation in app/lib/auth.ts
   - Changed from 'https://treasurehub.vercel.app' to 'https://treasurehub.club'
   - Fixed in sendResetPassword function

3. Updated organization invitation URL generation in app/lib/auth.ts
   - Changed from 'https://treasurehub.vercel.app' to 'https://treasurehub.club'
   - Fixed in sendInvitationEmail function

4. Updated CSRF trusted origins in app/lib/auth.ts
   - Changed from 'https://treasurehub.vercel.app' to 'https://treasurehub.club'
   - Ensures CSRF protection works correctly with production domain

Testing:
- Build completed successfully
- No compilation errors
- Ready for deployment to production

Expected Result:
- Email verification links will now work correctly
- Users can successfully verify their email addresses
- Password reset links will work correctly
- Organization invitation links will work correctly
