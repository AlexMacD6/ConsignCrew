# Module Resolution Fix Requirements

## Problem
The application was experiencing module resolution errors for Prisma imports in API routes, specifically:
- Error: Can't resolve '../../../lib/prisma' in app/api/questions/route.ts
- TypeScript path mapping was incorrectly configured

## Root Cause
- TypeScript configuration had path mapping `@/*` pointing to `./src/*` instead of `./app/*`
- Inconsistent import paths across API routes
- Some routes using relative paths, others potentially using incorrect paths

## Solution Requirements

### 1. TypeScript Configuration Fix
- Update tsconfig.json to map `@/*` to `./app/*` instead of `./src/*`
- Ensure proper module resolution for the app directory structure

### 2. Import Path Standardization
- Update API routes to use `@/lib/prisma` instead of relative paths
- Ensure consistent import patterns across all API routes
- Fix any incorrect relative path calculations

### 3. Module Resolution Verification
- Test all API routes to ensure they can resolve Prisma imports
- Verify that the development server starts without module resolution errors
- Check that all database operations work correctly

## Testing
- Start development server and verify no module resolution errors
- Test API endpoints that use Prisma to ensure they function correctly
- Verify that all imports resolve properly across the application
