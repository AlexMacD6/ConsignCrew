# Driver Management Integration Requirements

## Overview
Integration of the Review-to-Tip driver management system with the Delivery Operations module, including driver deletion functionality and complete removal of mock data.

## Core Requirements

### 1. Driver Deletion Functionality in Review-to-Tip Dashboard

#### Delete/Deactivate Driver Features
- **Two Distinct Actions**:
  - **Deactivate Button**: Soft delete (sets isActive = false, preserves all review data)
  - **Delete Button**: Hard delete (permanently removes driver and ALL associated data)
- **Deactivate Features**:
  - Simple confirmation dialog
  - Preserves all review scans, bonuses, and QR history
  - Driver can be reactivated later
  - Uses existing `/api/admin/drivers?id={id}` DELETE endpoint
- **Permanent Delete Features**:
  - Double confirmation with clear warnings about data loss
  - Permanently removes driver and ALL associated data (reviews, bonuses, scans)
  - Cannot be undone
  - Uses `/api/admin/drivers/{id}/permanent-delete` DELETE endpoint
  - Skull icon and red styling to indicate danger
- **Visual Distinction**: Clear UI differences between deactivate (outline button) and delete (red skull button)
- **Help Text**: Clear explanation of the difference between the two actions

#### User Interface Enhancements
- **Vehicle Type Field**: Added vehicle type selection to driver creation form
- **Enhanced Driver Display**: Shows vehicle type in driver list alongside other details
- **Action Buttons**: Clear deactivate/activate and delete buttons for each driver
- **Empty State**: Helpful message when no drivers are found

#### API Integration
- **Soft Delete Endpoint**: Uses existing `/api/admin/drivers?id={driverId}` endpoint (deactivation)
- **Hard Delete Endpoint**: New `/api/admin/drivers/{id}/permanent-delete` endpoint (permanent deletion)
- **PUT Endpoint**: Uses existing `/api/admin/drivers` endpoint for status updates
- **Error Handling**: Proper error messages and success notifications
- **Real-time Updates**: Refreshes driver list after any changes
- **Cascading Deletion**: Permanent delete removes all associated reviews, bonuses, and scans

### 2. Delivery Operations Integration

#### Complete Mock Data Removal
- **Driver Data**: Removed all mock driver data, now fetches from Review-to-Tip API
- **Schedule Data**: Removed mock schedule data, now uses real API endpoints
- **Capacity Management**: Real API integration for capacity updates
- **Error Handling**: Graceful fallback to empty states on API failures

#### Driver API Integration
- **Data Source**: `/api/admin/drivers?activeOnly=false` endpoint
- **Data Transformation**: Converts Review-to-Tip format to Delivery Operations format
- **Real-time Data**: Fetches fresh driver data on page load and refresh
- **Driver Status**: Shows both active and inactive drivers with proper status indicators

#### Enhanced User Experience
- **Manage Drivers Link**: Direct link to Review-to-Tip dashboard for driver management
- **Refresh Button**: Manual refresh capability for updated data
- **Loading States**: Proper loading indicators while fetching data
- **Error States**: Helpful error messages and empty states

### 3. API Enhancements

#### Vehicle Type Support
- **Driver Creation**: Added vehicleType field to driver creation API
- **Driver Updates**: Added vehicleType field to driver update API
- **Database Storage**: Proper storage and retrieval of vehicle type information
- **Optional Field**: Vehicle type is optional but recommended for delivery operations

#### Delivery Operations API Updates
- **Real Driver Data**: `/api/admin/delivery-operations/drivers` now fetches from driver table
- **Data Consistency**: Consistent driver data across both modules
- **Performance**: Efficient queries with proper field selection
- **Error Handling**: Robust error handling and meaningful error messages

### 4. Database Schema Considerations

#### Driver Model Integration
- **Shared Model**: Both modules use the same Driver model from Prisma
- **Field Compatibility**: All fields are compatible between Review-to-Tip and Delivery Operations
- **Data Integrity**: Consistent data structure and validation rules
- **Migration Ready**: Ready for database migrations if schema changes needed

### 5. User Interface Consistency

#### Design Integration
- **Consistent Styling**: Both modules follow TreasureHub design standards
- **Color Coding**: Consistent status colors and indicators
- **Button Styles**: Uniform button styling and interaction patterns
- **Responsive Design**: Both modules work on desktop and tablet devices

#### Navigation Flow
- **Cross-module Navigation**: Easy navigation between Review-to-Tip and Delivery Operations
- **Context Preservation**: Users understand the relationship between modules
- **Breadcrumb Logic**: Clear understanding of current location and available actions

### 6. Data Flow Architecture

#### API Integration Pattern
```
Review-to-Tip Dashboard (Driver Management)
    ↓ (Driver CRUD Operations)
Driver API (/api/admin/drivers)
    ↓ (Shared Driver Data)
Delivery Operations Dashboard (Driver Utilization)
```

#### Data Synchronization
- **Single Source of Truth**: Driver API serves as central driver repository
- **Real-time Updates**: Changes in Review-to-Tip immediately available in Delivery Operations
- **Data Consistency**: Both modules show identical driver information
- **Error Isolation**: Failures in one module don't affect the other

### 7. Security and Permissions

#### Admin Access Control
- **Consistent Authentication**: Both modules use same admin permission checking
- **Role-based Access**: Admin/Owner roles required for driver management
- **Organization Validation**: treasurehub-admin organization membership required
- **API Security**: All endpoints properly secured with session validation

### 8. Error Handling and User Experience

#### Graceful Degradation
- **API Failures**: Helpful error messages instead of crashes
- **Empty States**: Clear messaging when no data is available
- **Loading States**: Proper loading indicators during data fetching
- **Offline Handling**: Graceful handling of network connectivity issues

#### User Feedback
- **Success Messages**: Clear confirmation of successful operations
- **Error Messages**: Descriptive error messages for failed operations
- **Progress Indicators**: Visual feedback during long-running operations
- **Data Validation**: Client-side and server-side validation with helpful messages
