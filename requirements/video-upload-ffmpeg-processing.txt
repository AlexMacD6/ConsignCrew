# Video Upload with FFmpeg Processing - COMPLETED ✅

## Overview
Implement a comprehensive video upload feature that allows users to upload video files, processes them using FFmpeg, and integrates the results with AI analysis.

## System Requirements

### FFmpeg Installation (REQUIRED)
**FFmpeg must be installed on the server/system for video processing to work.**

#### Windows Installation:
```bash
# Using winget (recommended)
winget install ffmpeg

# Using Chocolatey
choco install ffmpeg

# Manual download from https://ffmpeg.org/download.html
```

#### macOS Installation:
```bash
# Using Homebrew
brew install ffmpeg
```

#### Linux Installation:
```bash
# Ubuntu/Debian
sudo apt update
sudo apt install ffmpeg

# CentOS/RHEL
sudo yum install ffmpeg

# Or download from https://ffmpeg.org/download.html
```

#### Verification:
After installation, verify FFmpeg is working:
```bash
ffmpeg -version
ffprobe -version
```

**Note:** The system will wait for FFmpeg to become available and retry processing if it's not initially found.

## Implementation Details

### COMPLETED ✅ - Core Features
- Video upload with drag-and-drop interface
- S3 presigned URL upload for raw video files
- FFmpeg video processing (compression, thumbnail, keyframe extraction)
- Background processing with real-time progress modal
- Integration with AI analysis system
- CloudFront CDN delivery for processed content

### COMPLETED ✅ - Technical Implementation
- Database schema with Video model
- API endpoints for upload, processing, and status
- React components for upload and processing UI
- FFmpeg processor service with error handling
- S3 integration for raw and processed storage
- AI service integration for video frame analysis

### COMPLETED ✅ - User Experience
- 3-step listing creation process (Video → Photos → AI Form)
- Background video processing while user continues with photos
- Real-time processing progress modal
- Error handling and retry mechanisms
- Seamless integration with existing photo upload flow

## Key Features Implemented

### Video Upload Component
- Drag-and-drop interface
- File validation (.mp4, .mov, max 250MB)
- Progress tracking
- Error handling

### Video Processing Modal
- Real-time progress display
- Processing status updates
- Error messages and retry options
- Automatic completion handling

### FFmpeg Processing Service
- Video compression (720p H.264, CRF 28)
- Thumbnail generation at 3 seconds
- Keyframe extraction at strategic timestamps (0%, 10%, 25%, 50%, 90%)
- Dynamic timestamp calculation using ffprobe
- Consistent frame sizing (1280x720)

### AI Integration
- Video frames passed to OpenAI GPT-4o for analysis
- Frame naming convention: frame_01.jpg, frame_02.jpg, etc.
- Enhanced product analysis with video content
- Fallback to photo-only analysis when video unavailable

## Testing Requirements

### Manual Testing
1. Upload video file (.mp4 or .mov)
2. Verify processing modal appears
3. Check background processing while continuing with photos
4. Verify AI analysis includes video frames
5. Test error handling (invalid files, processing failures)

### System Testing
1. Verify FFmpeg installation and availability
2. Test S3 upload and processing
3. Check CloudFront URL generation
4. Validate database record creation
5. Test AI service integration

## Next Steps for Deployment

### Production Setup
1. **Install FFmpeg on production server**
2. Configure S3 bucket permissions
3. Set up CloudFront distribution
4. Update environment variables
5. Test video processing pipeline

### Monitoring
1. Monitor FFmpeg process availability
2. Track video processing success rates
3. Monitor S3 storage usage
4. Check AI analysis performance

## Usage Example

```typescript
// Video upload flow
1. User selects video file
2. File uploaded to S3 via presigned URL
3. Video processing modal appears
4. FFmpeg processes video in background
5. User continues with photo upload
6. AI analysis includes video frames
7. Comprehensive listing generated
```

## Dependencies Added
- FFmpeg (system dependency)
- FFprobe (system dependency)
- AWS SDK (already present)
- Prisma (already present)

## Security Considerations
- File type validation
- File size limits
- S3 presigned URLs with expiration
- User authentication for video ownership
- Secure FFmpeg command execution

## Performance Considerations
- Background processing to avoid UI blocking
- Video compression for storage efficiency
- CloudFront CDN for fast delivery
- Efficient keyframe extraction
- AI model selection based on content availability
