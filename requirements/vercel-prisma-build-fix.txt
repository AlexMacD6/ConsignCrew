Fix Prisma Client Initialization Error on Vercel Build

- Resolve PrismaClientConstructorValidationError during Vercel build process
- Ensure Prisma client can be generated without database connection during build
- Modify Prisma client initialization to handle missing DATABASE_URL during build
- Update build configuration to properly handle Prisma client generation
- Ensure API routes don't fail during build time when database is not available
- Add proper error handling for database connection issues
- Update environment variable handling for production builds

Root Cause:
- DATABASE_URL environment variable is not available during Vercel build process
- Prisma client tries to validate database connection during initialization
- API routes are being evaluated during build time, causing the error

Solution:
- Modify Prisma client initialization to be lazy-loaded
- Add conditional database connection logic
- Update build scripts to handle Prisma generation properly
- Add proper error boundaries for database operations
