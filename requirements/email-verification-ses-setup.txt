# Email Verification SES Setup Requirements

## Issue Description
User registration was working but email verification emails were not being sent. BetterAuth was configured to require email verification but was only logging to console instead of actually sending emails via AWS SES.

## Root Cause
- BetterAuth email configuration was using placeholder functions that only logged to console
- AWS SES was already configured in the project but not integrated with BetterAuth
- Users couldn't log in because their email wasn't verified
- No actual email delivery was happening

## Solution Requirements

### 1. Integrate AWS SES with BetterAuth
- Use existing `ses-server.ts` utility for email sending
- Configure BetterAuth to use AWS SES for verification emails
- Add proper error handling and fallbacks
- Create professional email templates

### 2. Email Templates
- Design professional verification email template
- Design password reset email template
- Use TreasureHub branding and colors
- Include proper security messaging
- Add fallback text links for accessibility

### 3. Error Handling
- Add try-catch blocks around email sending
- Provide fallback to console logging for development
- Log email sending success/failure
- Handle AWS SES errors gracefully

## Implementation Details

### Files Modified
- `app/lib/auth.ts` - Updated BetterAuth email configuration

### Changes Made
1. **Integrated AWS SES** with BetterAuth email functions
2. **Created professional email templates** with TreasureHub branding
3. **Added error handling** with fallbacks
4. **Configured verification and reset emails** to use SES

### Code Changes
```typescript
// BetterAuth Email Configuration
emailAndPassword: {
  enabled: true,
  requireEmailVerification: true,
  sendVerificationEmail: async ({ user, url, token }) => {
    try {
      const { sendEmail } = await import('./ses-server');
      // Professional email template with TreasureHub branding
      await sendEmail(user.email, subject, html);
    } catch (error) {
      console.error('Failed to send verification email:', error);
      // Fallback to console log for development
    }
  },
  sendResetPassword: async ({ user, url, token }) => {
    // Similar implementation for password reset
  },
  provider: null, // Using custom email sending with AWS SES
}
```

## Email Template Features
