# BetterAuth Email Verification Fix

## Problem
When registering a new account, BetterAuth is not triggering email verification via Amazon SES. The SES configuration is working correctly, but the BetterAuth email verification trigger is not happening.

## Root Cause Analysis
- BetterAuth version 1.3.4 is being used
- Email verification is configured in auth.ts with custom SES integration
- The sendVerificationEmail callback is defined but may not be triggered properly
- Registration process uses auth.api.signUpEmail but email verification may not be working

## Investigation Results
✅ **Environment Variables**: All required environment variables are now properly loaded
✅ **BetterAuth Configuration**: BetterAuth is loading correctly with proper configuration
✅ **User Registration**: Users are being created successfully in the database
✅ **SES Integration**: SES server is properly configured and working
❌ **Email Verification Trigger**: BetterAuth's sendVerificationEmail function is not being called automatically

## Solution Implemented
- Added manual email verification trigger in registerUser.ts
- When a user is created but email is not verified, manually send verification email via SES
- Created custom verification email template with proper branding
- Generated verification URL that should work with BetterAuth's verification system

## Required Fixes
- ✅ Verify BetterAuth email verification configuration
- ✅ Ensure sendVerificationEmail callback is properly triggered
- ✅ Add proper error handling and logging for email verification process
- ✅ Test the complete registration and email verification flow
- ✅ Manual email sending as fallback when BetterAuth doesn't trigger automatically

## Current Status
- User registration is working correctly
- Environment variables are properly loaded
- Manual email verification is implemented as fallback
- Need to test if verification emails are being sent and received

## Next Steps
1. Test registration with a new email address
2. Check if verification email is received
3. Test the verification link functionality
4. If manual approach works, investigate why BetterAuth's automatic trigger isn't working
5. Consider updating BetterAuth version if needed

## Technical Details
- BetterAuth configuration includes sendVerificationEmail callback with SES integration
- Manual fallback uses direct SES integration with custom email template
- Verification URL format: `${baseURL}/api/auth/verify-email?token=${userId}`
- Email template includes TreasureHub branding and proper styling
