# Listing View Tracking Feature

## Problem
- Profile page was showing "0 views" for all listings because view tracking wasn't implemented
- No way to track how many times users view listing detail pages
- Missing valuable analytics data for sellers to understand listing performance

## Solution
Implement proper view tracking system that increments a counter each time someone visits a listing detail page.

## Changes Made

### 1. Database Schema Update
- **File**: `prisma/schema.prisma`
- **Change**: Added `views` field to Listing model
- **Type**: `Int @default(0)`
- **Migration**: Created and applied migration `20250802024805_add_views_to_listings`

### 2. View Tracking API
- **File**: `app/api/listings/[id]/view/route.ts`
- **Purpose**: API endpoint to increment view count
- **Method**: POST
- **Functionality**: 
  - Increments view count by 1 for the specified listing
  - Uses Prisma's `increment` operation for atomic updates
  - Returns updated view count
  - Handles errors gracefully

### 3. Listing Detail Page Integration
- **File**: `app/(dashboard)/list-item/[id]/page.tsx`
- **Change**: Added view tracking call after successful listing fetch
- **Implementation**: 
  - Calls `/api/listings/${params.id}/view` endpoint
  - Non-blocking - doesn't fail page load if view tracking fails
  - Includes views field in transformed listing data

### 4. API Routes Updated
- **Files**: `app/api/listings/route.ts`, `app/api/listings/[id]/route.ts`
- **Change**: Automatically include `views` field in all listing queries
- **Result**: Views are now included in all listing data responses

## Technical Details

### View Tracking Flow
1. User visits listing detail page
2. Page fetches listing data from `/api/listings/[id]`
3. After successful fetch, page calls `/api/listings/[id]/view` to increment counter
4. View count is updated atomically in database
5. Profile page displays actual view counts

### Database Schema
```prisma
model Listing {
  // ... existing fields
  views                Int      @default(0) // Track number of views
  // ... other fields
}
```

### API Endpoint
```typescript
POST /api/listings/[id]/view
// Increments view count for listing
// Returns: { success: true, views: number }
```

## Benefits
- **Real Analytics**: Sellers can see actual view counts for their listings
- **Performance Insights**: Helps sellers understand which listings are getting attention
- **User Experience**: Provides meaningful data instead of fake "0 views"
- **Atomic Updates**: Uses Prisma's increment for thread-safe view counting

## Testing Instructions
1. Visit a listing detail page
2. Check the profile page to see if view count increased
3. Visit the same listing multiple times to verify counting
4. Check different listings to ensure counts are independent

## Future Enhancements
- Add view tracking analytics dashboard
- Implement view history with timestamps
- Add unique view tracking (prevent same user from incrementing multiple times)
- Add view notifications for sellers
- Implement view-based sorting options

## Dependencies
- Prisma ORM for database operations
- Existing listing API infrastructure
- No new external dependencies required
