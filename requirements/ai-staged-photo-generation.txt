# AI Staged Photo Generation Feature

## Problem
Users want professional-looking product photos for their listings, but they may not have access to professional photography equipment or staging. This can result in lower-quality listings that don't attract buyers.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. AI-Generated Staged Photos
- **DALL-E 3 Integration**: Uses OpenAI's DALL-E 3 to generate professional product photos
- **Vision API Analysis**: First analyzes user photos to understand the product
- **Professional Staging**: Creates clean, studio-quality images with proper lighting and backgrounds
- **Automatic Generation**: Generates staged photos automatically during AI analysis

### 2. Photo Gallery Integration
- **First Position**: Staged photo appears as the first image in the photo gallery
- **Visual Indicators**: Purple "AI" and "Staged" badges to identify AI-generated content
- **Loading State**: Shows loading spinner while generating
- **Error Handling**: Graceful error handling if generation fails

### 3. Technical Implementation
- **New API Endpoint**: `/api/ai/generate-staged-photo` for photo generation
- **Vision API Analysis**: Analyzes user photos to create detailed product descriptions
- **DALL-E 3 Generation**: Uses product analysis to generate professional staged photos
- **Database Storage**: Stores staged photo URL in the listing's photos object

## Files Modified
- `app/api/ai/generate-staged-photo/route.ts` - New API endpoint for staged photo generation
- `app/lib/ai-service.ts` - Added staged photo generation function
- `app/(dashboard)/list-item/page.tsx` - Updated to generate and display staged photos
- `app/api/listings/route.ts` - Updated to handle staged photo storage

## Technical Changes

### New API Endpoint
```typescript
// app/api/ai/generate-staged-photo/route.ts
export async function POST(request: NextRequest) {
  // 1. Analyze product photos using Vision API
  // 2. Generate DALL-E 3 prompt from analysis
  // 3. Create professional staged photo
  // 4. Return staged photo URL
}
```

### AI Service Integration
```typescript
// app/lib/ai-service.ts
export async function generateStagedPhoto(request: StagedPhotoRequest): Promise<StagedPhotoResponse> {
  // Calls the staged photo generation API
}
```

### Frontend Integration
```typescript
// app/(dashboard)/list-item/page.tsx
const generateStagedPhotoAsync = async (photoUrls, description, department, category) => {
  // Generates staged photo in parallel with AI analysis
};
```

### Photo Gallery Display
```typescript
{/* Staged Photo (AI Generated) */}
{stagedPhoto.url && (
  <div className="relative">
    <img src={stagedPhoto.url} alt="AI Staged Photo" />
    <div className="absolute top-1 left-1 bg-purple-500 text-white text-xs px-1 rounded">
      AI
    </div>
    <div className="absolute top-1 right-1 bg-purple-500 text-white text-xs px-1 rounded">
      Staged
    </div>
  </div>
)}
```

## User Experience

### Workflow
1. **Upload Photos**: User uploads their product photos
2. **AI Analysis**: System analyzes photos and generates listing information
3. **Staged Photo Generation**: AI creates professional staged photo in parallel
4. **Photo Gallery**: Staged photo appears first, followed by user photos
5. **Listing Creation**: Staged photo is included in the final listing

### Visual Indicators
- **Purple "AI" badge**: Identifies AI-generated content
- **Purple "Staged" badge**: Indicates professional staging
- **Loading spinner**: Shows generation progress
- **Numbered sequence**: Staged photo is position 1, user photos follow

## Benefits
