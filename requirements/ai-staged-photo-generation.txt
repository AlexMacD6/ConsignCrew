AI Staged Photo Generation Enhancement

- Make proof photo (AI-generated staged photo) required instead of optional
- Implement actual image generation from AI staging prompts using DALL-E
- Ensure AI-generated staged photos appear in the image carousel
- Add Phase 3 to the AI workflow for actual image generation

Technical Changes:
- Updated photo requirements to require proof photo (AI-generated staged photo)
- Created new API endpoint `/api/ai/generate-image` for DALL-E image generation
- Added Phase 3 to AI workflow to generate actual images from staging prompts
- Updated form validation to require proof photo
- Enhanced form submission to include staged photo data
- Added fallback mechanisms when image generation fails

Files Modified:
- app/(dashboard)/list-item/page.tsx - Updated photo requirements and added Phase 3
- app/api/ai/generate-image/route.ts - New endpoint for DALL-E image generation
- requirements/ai-staged-photo-generation.txt - This requirements document

AI Workflow:
1. Phase 1: Generate comprehensive listing data
2. Phase 2: Generate staging prompt for photorealistic image
3. Phase 3: Use DALL-E to generate actual image from staging prompt
4. Save generated image as proof photo in the photos object

Expected Outcome:
- Users will see AI-generated staged photos in the image carousel
- Proof photo will be required for form submission
- AI-generated images will be professional, staged product photos
- Fallback to original photos if AI generation fails
- Improved visual appeal of listings with professional staging
