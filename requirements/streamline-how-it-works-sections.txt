# Streamline How It Works Sections

## Problem
- "How It Works" content is duplicated across multiple pages (main landing, seller landing, admin)
- Content is written inline in each page, making updates difficult
- Need to create reusable components to eliminate duplication

## Requirements
1. Create a reusable `HowItWorksBuyer` component for buyer-focused steps
2. Create a reusable `HowItWorksSeller` component for seller-focused steps  
3. Replace inline content in all pages with these components
4. Ensure consistent styling and animations across all instances
5. Make future updates easier by centralizing content

## Components to Create
- `app/components/HowItWorksBuyer.tsx` - 5-step buyer process
- `app/components/HowItWorksSeller.tsx` - 5-step seller process

## Pages to Update
- `app/page.tsx` - Replace inline buyer How It Works
- `app/seller-landing/page.tsx` - Replace inline seller How It Works  
- `app/admin/page.tsx` - Replace inline How It Works

## Benefits
- Single source of truth for each How It Works section
- Easier maintenance and updates
- Consistent styling and behavior
- Reduced code duplication
- Better component reusability
