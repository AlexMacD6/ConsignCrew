# Price Drop Counter API Optimization

## Overview
Fix the excessive API calls issue in the PriceDropCounter component by implementing efficient client-side countdown logic and reducing unnecessary server requests.

## Issues to Address

### 1. Excessive API Calls
- **Problem**: Price drop counter makes API calls every second when countdown reaches zero
- **Root Cause**: Component refreshes data every 2 seconds after countdown completion
- **Solution**: Implement efficient client-side countdown with minimal API refreshes

### 2. Incorrect Time Parsing
- **Problem**: Component tries to parse new day-based format with old hourly parsing logic
- **Root Cause**: `parseTimeString` function doesn't handle "3 days", "1 day" format
- **Solution**: Update parsing logic to handle new day-based format correctly

### 3. Inefficient Countdown Intervals
- **Problem**: Uses 1-second intervals even for day-based countdowns
- **Root Cause**: Fixed interval regardless of countdown duration
- **Solution**: Use adaptive intervals based on countdown duration

## Technical Changes Required

### Time Parsing Updates
- Update `parseTimeString` to handle new day-based format
- Support "3 days", "1 day", "Any moment now..." formats
- Maintain backward compatibility with old hourly format

### Countdown Logic Optimization
- Use adaptive intervals: 1 minute for day-based, 1 second for hour-based countdowns
- Implement proper refresh timeout management to prevent multiple simultaneous refreshes
- Increase refresh delay from 2 seconds to 45 seconds to reduce API load
- Add refs to track and prevent duplicate refresh calls

### Memory Management
- Proper cleanup of intervals and timeouts on component unmount
- Clear existing intervals before setting new ones
- Prevent memory leaks from multiple simultaneous timers

## Files Modified
- `app/components/PriceDropCounter.tsx` - Updated countdown logic and time parsing

## Testing Instructions
1. Navigate to a listing with price drop schedule configured
2. Verify countdown displays correctly without excessive API calls
3. Check that "Any moment now..." state doesn't trigger rapid API calls
4. Test with different countdown durations (days vs hours)
5. Verify proper cleanup when component unmounts

## Expected Outcomes
- Significantly reduced API calls (from every 2 seconds to every 45 seconds)
- Correct parsing of day-based time formats
- Efficient countdown intervals based on duration
- No memory leaks from timer management
- Smooth user experience without server overload
