# Buyer Pain Points Section

**Objective:**
Create a buyer-focused pain points section for the main landing page that addresses the frustrations of buying on Facebook Marketplace, with interactive clickable X's to eliminate each pain point.

**Requirements Implemented:**

### 1. Buyer-Focused Pain Points
- **"Is this still available?"** - Addresses ghosting and availability issues
- **"Can you hold it for me?"** - Addresses holding/reservation problems
- **"Will you take $20 less?"** - Addresses price negotiation frustrations
- **"Can you meet me halfway?"** - Addresses meeting location issues
- **"Any damage or scratches?"** - Addresses quality concerns
- **"Can you deliver to my house?"** - Addresses delivery logistics
- **"What's your best price?"** - Addresses pricing transparency
- **"Is this authentic/real?"** - Addresses authenticity concerns

### 2. Interactive Features
- **Clickable Pain Points**: Each frustration bubble is clickable
- **X Overlay**: Clicking shows a large animated X to "eliminate" the frustration
- **Hover Effects**: Hover animations with treasure color scheme
- **State Management**: Tracks which pain points have been clicked
- **Visual Feedback**: Clicked points become non-interactive with faded text

### 3. Visual Design
- **Dark Background**: Black background for high contrast
- **Treasure Color Scheme**: Uses treasure-500/600 colors instead of red
- **Grid Layout**: 2x4 grid on mobile, 4x2 on desktop
- **Backdrop Blur**: Modern glassmorphism effects

### 4. Educational Content

### 5. Technical Implementation

### 7. Key Differences from Seller Version

#### **Content Focus:**

- **Buyer Version**: Addresses buyer frustrations (availability, quality, pricing, etc.)

#### **Color Scheme:**
- **Seller Version**: Red color scheme (red-500/600)
- **Buyer Version**: Treasure color scheme (treasure-500/600)

#### **Headline:**
- **Seller Version**: "Silence the Inbox Noise"
- **Buyer Version**: "No More Buyer Frustrations"

#### **Subheadline:**
- **Seller Version**: "With TreasureHub, these frustrating interactions are eliminated."

### 8. User Experience
