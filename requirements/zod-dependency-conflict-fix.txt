# Zod Dependency Conflict Fix

## Problem
- Vercel build failing with ERESOLVE error
- Conflict between openai@5.11.0 (requires zod@^3.23.8) and project's zod@^4.0.10
- better-auth also depends on zod@^4.0.5

## Solution
- Downgraded zod from ^4.0.10 to ^3.23.8 in package.json

- Cleaned node_modules and package-lock.json for fresh install

## Changes Made
1. Updated package.json:
   - Changed "zod": "^4.0.10" to "zod": "^3.23.8"


   - Changed from "../../../../lib/prisma" to "../../../lib/prisma"

## Verification
- npm install completed successfully
- npm run build completed successfully
- All Zod usage in codebase is compatible with v3.x

## Dependencies Updated
- zod: ^4.0.10 â†’ ^3.23.8

## Notes
- Zod v3.x is fully compatible with all current usage in the codebase
- No breaking changes were introduced
- Build now passes on Vercel
