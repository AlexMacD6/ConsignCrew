# Image Carousel Feature for Listings Gallery

## Problem
The listings gallery currently shows only a single static image per listing, making it difficult for users to view all available photos of an item without opening the full listing details.

## Requirements
- Add a carousel component to display multiple images for each listing
- Allow users to navigate through images using left/right arrow buttons
- Show image counter (e.g., "2 / 5") to indicate current position
- Display navigation dots at the bottom for quick image selection
- Support keyboard navigation (arrow keys)
- Maintain responsive design for different screen sizes
- Show carousel only when multiple images are available

## Technical Implementation

### Components Created
1. **ImageCarousel.tsx** - Reusable carousel component with:
   - Left/right navigation arrows
   - Image counter display
   - Navigation dots
   - Keyboard navigation support
   - Hover effects for arrows
   - Auto-play capability (optional)

### Features Implemented
1. **Modal View Enhancement**:
   - Replaced single image with carousel in listing detail modal
   - Shows all available images (hero, back, proof, additional)
   - Full-size carousel with arrows and dots

2. **Grid View Enhancement**:
   - Added carousel to grid items when multiple images exist
   - Compact carousel with arrows only (no dots)
   - Falls back to single image when only one photo available

3. **Data Transformation**:
   - Created `all_images` array containing all available photos
   - Filters out null/undefined values
   - Converts S3 keys to CloudFront URLs using existing helper function

### User Experience
- **Hover to Reveal**: Navigation arrows appear on hover
- **Visual Feedback**: Smooth transitions and hover effects
- **Accessibility**: Keyboard navigation and ARIA labels
- **Responsive**: Works on mobile and desktop
- **Performance**: Only loads carousel when multiple images exist

## Testing Instructions
1. Navigate to the listings page
2. Look for listings with multiple photos (should show carousel in grid)

4. Click on a listing to open modal
5. Test carousel navigation in modal:
