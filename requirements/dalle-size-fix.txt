DALL-E Size Fix Requirements

- Standardize on 1024x1024 as the DALL-E image generation size
- Remove size mapping complexity since we're using a single standard size
- Ensure AI-generated staged photos appear in the image carousel
- Maintain fallback behavior when DALL-E generation fails

Problem:
- DALL-E 3 only supports sizes: "1024x1024", "1792x1024", "1024x1792"
- The AI was requesting "1536x1536" which caused a 400 error
- This prevented the generated staged photo from appearing in listings

Technical Changes:
- Updated Phase 2 prompt to use "1024x1024" as the standard target resolution
- Simplified DALL-E API call to use "1024x1024" directly (no size mapping needed)
- Updated all fallback values from "1536x1536" to "1024x1024"
- Enhanced error handling to continue gracefully when DALL-E fails
- Added better logging for DALL-E generation process

Files Modified:
- app/lib/ai-service.ts - Updated Phase 2 prompt and fallback values
- app/api/ai/generate-staged-photo/route.ts - Simplified DALL-E size handling
- app/api/ai/generate-comprehensive-listing/route.ts - Updated fallback values
- app/(dashboard)/list-item/page.tsx - Updated frontend fallback values

Expected Results:
- DALL-E images will now generate successfully with 1024x1024 resolution
- AI-generated staged photos will appear in the image carousel
- Fallback to original photos if DALL-E generation fails
- Improved user experience with professional staged photos
- Simplified and more reliable image generation process
