Google Places API Address Auto-Population Fix

Problem:
- When selecting an address from the Google Places API dropdown in the profile page, the city, state, zip code, and country fields were not auto-populating
- The form state was being updated correctly but then immediately reset by a useEffect that was fetching user data from the database

Root Cause:
- The useEffect in profile/page.tsx had dependencies [router, session, sessionLoading] and was calling setForm(data.user) which reset the form state back to the original user data from the database
- This was overwriting the address changes made by the Google Places API selection

Solution:
1. Modified the useEffect to only set form data when not in edit mode or when form is empty
2. Added editMode and form to the useEffect dependencies to prevent overwriting user changes
3. Cleaned up debugging console logs and UI elements
4. Simplified the handleAddressSelect function to use functional form of setState

Changes Made:
- app/profile/page.tsx:
  - Modified useEffect to conditionally set form data: if (!editMode || Object.keys(form).length === 0)
  - Added editMode and form to useEffect dependencies
  - Simplified handleAddressSelect function
  - Removed debugging console logs and UI elements

- app/components/AddressAutocomplete.tsx:
  - Removed debugging console logs
  - Kept the core functionality intact

Expected Behavior:
- When user clicks "Edit" on profile page
- When user types in street address field and selects an address from Google Places dropdown
- The city, state, zip code, and country fields should auto-populate with the selected address data
- The form state should persist the changes and not be reset by the useEffect

Testing:
1. Go to profile page and click "Edit"
2. Type in street address field (e.g., "1807 Greengrass")
3. Select an address from the dropdown
4. Verify that city, state, zip code, and country fields auto-populate
5. Verify that the values persist and don't get reset
