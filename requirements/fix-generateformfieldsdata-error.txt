Fix generateFormFieldsData Internal Server Error

## Problem
- Error: "Phase 2 failed: Internal Server Error at generateFormFieldsData" in list-item/page.tsx
- The error was occurring because the generateFormFieldsData function was trying to set state variables for new Facebook Shop fields that didn't exist in the component

## Root Cause
- When we added new Facebook Shop product specification fields to the database schema and API endpoints, we didn't add the corresponding state variables to the list-item page component
- The generateFormFieldsData function was trying to call setter functions like setQuantity, setSalePrice, setGender, etc., but these state variables weren't defined

## Solution
- Added missing state variables for all new Facebook Shop product specification fields:
  - quantity, salePrice, salePriceEffectiveDate, itemGroupId
  - gender, color, size, ageGroup, material, pattern, style, productType
  - tags, tagInput
- Added tag management functions (addTag, removeTag, handleTagKeyPress)
- Updated generateFormFieldsData function to properly set these new state variables
- Updated handleSubmit function to include these new fields in the form submission

## Changes Made
1. Added state variables for all new Facebook Shop fields in list-item/page.tsx
2. Added tag management helper functions
3. Updated generateFormFieldsData to set new state variables from AI response
4. Updated handleSubmit to include new fields in form submission data
5. Added complete Product Specifications UI section with all new Facebook Shop fields to list-item/page.tsx
6. Added complete Product Specifications UI section with all new Facebook Shop fields to edit listing page (app/(dashboard)/list-item/[id]/edit/page.tsx)
7. Added Product Specifications display section to listing detail page (app/(dashboard)/list-item/[id]/page.tsx)
8. Enhanced error handling and logging in generateFormFieldsData Phase 2 for better debugging
9. Added confidence indicators to all new Facebook Shop fields on both list-item and edit listing pages
10. Added helpful tooltips for non-intuitive fields (Item Group ID, Product Type, Tags)

## Testing
- Verify that AI form generation works without Internal Server Error
- Verify that new Facebook Shop fields are properly populated from AI analysis
- Verify that form submission includes all new fields
- Verify that tag management functions work correctly
- Verify that all new Product Specifications fields are visible and editable on the list-item page
- Verify that all new Product Specifications fields are visible and editable on the edit listing page
- Verify that existing listings load with their Product Specifications data when editing
- Verify that Product Specifications are displayed on the listing detail page when available
