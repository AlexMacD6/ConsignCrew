# Next.js Dependencies Fix

## Issue
- TypeScript errors in Next.js application due to missing dependencies
- Errors included:
  - Cannot find module 'next/navigation'
  - Cannot find module 'lucide-react'
  - Button component variant prop type errors

## Root Cause
- Project had Next.js application structure but Vite-based package.json
- Missing Next.js dependencies and related packages
- Missing utility functions and type definitions

## Solution
- Installed Next.js and related dependencies
- Updated package.json scripts to use Next.js instead of Vite
- Added missing UI component dependencies
- Created missing utility files

## Changes Made

### Dependencies Added
- next@latest
- react@latest  
- react-dom@latest
- lucide-react
- @radix-ui/react-slot
- class-variance-authority
- clsx
- tailwind-merge
- @types/node
- typescript
- @types/react
- @types/react-dom

### Files Created/Updated
- Updated package.json scripts to use Next.js commands
- Created app/lib/utils.ts with cn function
- Updated tsconfig.json (already properly configured)

### Scripts Changed
- dev: "vite" → "next dev"
- build: "vite build" → "next build"
- preview: "vite preview" → "next start"
- Added: "lint": "next lint"

## Testing
- Next.js development server should now start without TypeScript errors
- All imports should resolve correctly
- Button component variant props should work properly
- Application should be accessible at http://localhost:3000

## Notes
- Used --legacy-peer-deps flag to resolve React version compatibility issues
- Maintained existing Next.js configuration in next.config.ts
- Preserved existing TypeScript configuration
