ProductType Field Removal Requirements

- Remove references to the non-existent `productType` field from the database schema
- Fix the "column 'productType' does not exist" error in listing creation
- Clean up all references to productType in API routes and frontend components
- Ensure the application works without the productType field

Technical Changes:
- Removed productType field from API route destructuring in:
  - app/api/listings/route.ts
  - app/api/listings/[id]/route.ts
- Removed productType from database creation calls
- Updated Facebook Shop export to use category instead of productType
- Removed productType from comprehensive listing generation
- Cleaned up frontend display components that referenced productType
- Removed productType from form data handling

Files Modified:
- app/api/listings/route.ts
- app/api/listings/[id]/route.ts
- app/api/ai/generate-comprehensive-listing/route.ts

- app/(dashboard)/list-item/[id]/page.tsx

Expected Outcome:
- Listing creation should work without database errors
- All productType references should be removed from the codebase
- Application should function normally using existing fields like category
- No more "column 'productType' does not exist" errors
