# Edit Listing Page Taxonomy and Discount Schedule Fix

## Issues Addressed

### 1. Taxonomy Mismatch
- **Problem**: The edit listing page had a different taxonomy structure than the listing creation page, causing category and sub-category dropdowns to not populate correctly
- **Solution**: Updated the taxonomy object in `app/(dashboard)/list-item/[id]/edit/page.tsx` to match the comprehensive Facebook Marketplace-aligned categories from `app/(dashboard)/list-item/page.tsx`

### 2. Missing Discount Schedule Field
- **Problem**: The discount schedule field was not visible in the edit listing page
- **Solution**: The discount schedule field was already present in the form but needed proper data loading logic

### 3. Price Drop Counter Blinking
- **Problem**: The price drop counter was blinking between "Next Price Drop" and "Loading" due to state management issues
- **Solution**: Fixed the PriceDropCounter component to prevent unnecessary loading states and improve refresh logic

## Changes Made

### Edit Listing Page (`app/(dashboard)/list-item/[id]/edit/page.tsx`)
- Updated taxonomy object to include all categories from the listing creation page:
  - Added missing categories: "Clothing & Accessories", "Sporting Goods", "Tools & Hardware", "Pet Supplies", "Beauty & Health", "Office & Business", "Garden & Outdoor", "Collectibles", "Music", "Video Games & Consoles", "Appliances", "Arts & Crafts", "Baby & Kids", "Jewelry & Watches", "Entertainment"
  - Fixed category structure to match the creation page exactly
  - Ensured proper sub-category mapping

### Price Drop Counter (`app/components/PriceDropCounter.tsx`)
- Fixed loading state logic to prevent blinking:
  - Only show loading spinner when no price drop info is available
  - Clear errors when successful data is fetched
  - Reduced refresh delay from 5 seconds to 2 seconds for better UX
  - Improved state management to prevent unnecessary re-renders

## Testing Instructions

1. Navigate to an existing listing's edit page (e.g., `/list-item/EJCONC/edit`)
2. Verify that:
   - Department dropdown shows the correct department (e.g., "Furniture")
   - Category dropdown populates with the correct category (not "Select Category")
   - Sub-category dropdown appears and shows the correct sub-category
   - Discount Schedule dropdown is visible and shows the current schedule
3. Test the price drop counter on a listing page to ensure it doesn't blink between states

## Expected Behavior

- Edit listing page should now correctly display all taxonomy fields with proper values
- Discount schedule should be visible and editable
- Price drop counter should display smoothly without blinking
- All form fields should maintain their values when editing
