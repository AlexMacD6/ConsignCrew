- Store both internal category and Facebook category for each listing
- Ensure backward compatibility with existing listings

### 3. Frontend Updates

## Technical Implementation

### Category Mapping Strategy
1. **Direct Mapping**: Where TreasureHub categories have direct Facebook equivalents
2. **Subcategory Mapping**: Use subcategories to determine the best Facebook category
3. **Fallback Mapping**: Default to "Other" for categories without clear equivalents

### Priority Categories
1. Electronics (high volume, clear mapping)
2. Furniture (high value, clear mapping)
3. Clothing & Accessories (high volume, needs Fashion category)
4. Home & Garden (broad category, needs consolidation)
