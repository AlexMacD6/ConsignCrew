# Roadmap Component Separation

## Overview
Separate the roadmap component from the TreasureMapCards component and place it as a standalone section below the "Why ConsignCrew" component.

## Changes Made

### 1. Created New Roadmap Component
- Created `app/components/Roadmap.tsx` as a standalone component
- Extracted `RoadmapNode` and `Roadmap` components from `TreasureMapCards.tsx`
- Maintained all existing functionality including:
  - Bouncing red circle nodes
  - Content cards with bulleted details
  - Swaying red dotted line animation
  - Framer Motion animations and hover effects

### 2. Updated TreasureMapCards Component
- Removed `RoadmapNodeProps` interface
- Removed `RoadmapNode` component definition
- Removed `Roadmap` component definition
- Removed `<Roadmap />` component call from within the component
- Cleaned up imports and dependencies

### 3. Updated Main Page Layout
- Added import for `Roadmap` component in `app/page.tsx`
- Replaced existing roadmap section with new `Roadmap` component
- Updated section title to "Your Treasure Map"
- Updated section description to "Follow the path to stress-free selling with our detailed process"
- Maintained existing styling and layout structure

## Technical Implementation

### Component Structure
- `Roadmap.tsx`: Standalone component with `RoadmapNode` and `Roadmap` sub-components
- `TreasureMapCards.tsx`: Focused only on treasure map cards with 3D sand reveal
- `page.tsx`: Updated to render `Roadmap` component separately

### Animation Features
- Bouncing red circle nodes with staggered delays
- Swaying red dotted line using CSS gradients and Framer Motion
- Content cards with hover effects and scale animations
- Staggered fade-in animations for nodes

### Data Structure
- `roadmapData` array containing three main sections:
  - Zero Hassle Listing
  - Transparent Earnings  
  - Safe & Fast Payout
- Each section includes title and detailed bullet points

## User Experience
- Roadmap now appears as a separate, dedicated section below the treasure cards
- Clear visual separation between the "Why ConsignCrew" sand reveal and the roadmap
- Maintains the treasure map theme with red dotted lines and nodes
- Responsive design that works on all screen sizes
