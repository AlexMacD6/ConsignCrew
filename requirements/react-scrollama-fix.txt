# React Scrollama useInView Hook Fix

## Issue
- TypeError: (0 , react_scrollama__WEBPACK_IMPORTED_MODULE_2__.useInView) is not a function
- The useInView hook does not exist in react-scrollama package
- react-scrollama only exports Scrollama and Step components, not hooks

## Changes Made
- Replaced react-scrollama with react-intersection-observer
  - Installed react-intersection-observer package
  - Updated ScrollSection.tsx to use useInView from react-intersection-observer
  - Fixed ref destructuring to use proper object destructuring
- Removed incorrect type definitions
  - Deleted types/react-scrollama.d.ts as it was incorrect
  - react-intersection-observer has proper TypeScript support

## Dependencies
- react-intersection-observer: ^9.8.1 (newly installed)
- react-scrollama: ^2.4.2 (kept for other components that might use it)

## Testing
- Verify that ScrollSection component renders without errors
- Check that scroll animations work properly
- Ensure TypeScript compilation passes without errors
