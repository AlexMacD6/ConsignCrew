# Edit Listing Photo Upload Fix

## Issue
The photo upload functionality in the edit listing page was failing with "Failed to upload image" error because the `handleImageChange` function was not providing the required parameters to the photo upload API.

## Root Cause
The photo upload API (`/api/upload/photo`) requires three parameters:
- `file` - The image file
- `photoType` - The type of photo (hero, back, proof, additional)
- `itemId` - The listing item ID

The original `handleImageChange` function was only sending the file, missing the required `photoType` and `itemId` parameters.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Enhanced handleImageChange Function
- Added proper FormData creation with all required parameters
- Set `photoType` to "additional" for edit page uploads
- Used the listing's `itemId` from URL parameters
- Added file type validation
- Improved error handling with detailed error messages

### 2. Photo Management Integration
- New photos are added to the `additional` photos array
- Photos are automatically added to the photo order for drag-and-drop functionality
- Error state is cleared on successful upload
- Better error messages for debugging

### 3. User Experience Improvements
- File type validation prevents invalid uploads
- Clear error messages help users understand issues
- Photos appear immediately in the drag-and-drop grid
- Seamless integration with existing photo management system

## Files Modified
- `app/(dashboard)/list-item/[id]/edit/page.tsx` - Fixed handleImageChange function

## Technical Details
```typescript
// Before: Missing required parameters
const formData = new FormData();
formData.append("file", file);

// After: Complete parameter set
const formData = new FormData();
formData.append("file", file);
formData.append("photoType", "additional");
formData.append("itemId", params.id as string);
```

## Benefits
- Fixes photo upload functionality in edit listing page
- Maintains consistency with photo upload API requirements
- Improves error handling and user feedback
- Integrates seamlessly with drag-and-drop photo management
- Prevents invalid file uploads with proper validation
