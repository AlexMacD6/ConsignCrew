# Photo Management Enhancements for Edit Listing Page

## Overview
Enhanced the edit listing page with advanced photo management capabilities including photo highlighting, type changing, and bulk upload functionality.

## New Features Implemented

### 1. Photo Highlighting & Selection
- **Click to Select**: Users can click on any photo to highlight it with a golden border
- **Visual Feedback**: Selected photos show a prominent golden border with shadow and ring effects
- **Toggle Selection**: Clicking the same photo again deselects it
- **Persistent Dropdown**: Photo type dropdown remains visible for selected photos

### 2. Enhanced Photo Type Changing
- **Improved Dropdown**: Photo type selector now has emojis and better styling
- **Always Visible for Selected**: Dropdown shows permanently for selected photos, not just on hover
- **Quick Action Buttons**: Selected photos show action buttons below the grid for easy type changing
- **Smart Disabling**: Options are disabled when photo types already exist (prevents duplicates)

### 3. Bulk Photo Upload
- **Multiple File Selection**: Users can select multiple photos at once using file picker
- **Drag and Drop Support**: Full drag and drop functionality for bulk uploads
- **Visual Upload Area**: Dedicated drop zone with clear instructions
- **Batch Processing**: All selected photos upload simultaneously
- **Auto-categorization**: Bulk uploads default to "Additional" photos, then can be changed individually

### 4. Improved User Experience
- **Instructional Guide**: Blue info box explaining how to use all photo management features
- **Selected Photo Panel**: Shows information and quick actions for the currently selected photo
- **Better Visual Hierarchy**: Clear separation between single and bulk upload options
- **Responsive Design**: Works well on desktop and mobile devices

## Technical Implementation

### State Management
```typescript
const [selectedPhoto, setSelectedPhoto] = useState<string | null>(null);
```

### Photo Selection
```typescript
onClick={() => setSelectedPhoto(selectedPhoto === photoId ? null : photoId)}
className={`relative group cursor-pointer border-2 rounded-lg overflow-hidden transition-all duration-200 ${
  selectedPhoto === photoId
    ? "border-[#D4AF3D] border-4 shadow-lg ring-2 ring-[#D4AF3D]/30"
    : "border-gray-200 hover:border-gray-300"
}`}
```

### Bulk Upload Handler
```typescript
const handleBulkImageChange = async (e: React.ChangeEvent<HTMLInputElement>) => {
  const fileArray = Array.from(files);
  const uploadPromises = fileArray.map(async (file) => {
    // Upload each file as "additional" photo
  });
  const results = await Promise.all(uploadPromises);
  // Update photos state with all results
};
```

### Drag and Drop Support
```typescript
const handleBulkDrop = (e: React.DragEvent) => {
  e.preventDefault();
  const files = e.dataTransfer.files;
  if (files && files.length > 0) {
    const syntheticEvent = { target: { files } };
    handleBulkImageChange(syntheticEvent);
  }
};
```

## User Interface Enhancements
