# React Three Cannon API Fix Requirements

## Problem
- TypeError: `useWorld` is not a function from `@react-three/cannon`
- The `useWorld` hook was deprecated or removed in newer versions of `@react-three/cannon`
- This was causing the packing tetris game to crash when trying to track crate fullness

## Root Cause
- Updated Three.js ecosystem to latest versions for React 19 compatibility
- `@react-three/cannon` API changed between versions
- `useWorld` hook is no longer available in the current version

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Removed Deprecated API Usage
- **Removed**: `useWorld` hook from `useCrateFull.ts`
- **Replaced**: With a global state tracking system

### 2. Created Global State Tracking System
- **Global Variables**: `globalBoxCount`, `globalMaxY`, `boxPositions`
- **Update Function**: `updateBoxStats(boxId, y)` to track individual box positions
- **Aggregation**: Automatically calculates total count and max height

### 3. Modified Box Components
- **Individual Tracking**: Each Box component now tracks its own position
- **Real-time Updates**: Uses `useFrame` to continuously update position data
- **Crate Bounds**: Only tracks boxes within the crate boundaries (|x| < 4, |z| < 4, y > 0)

### 4. Updated Component Interfaces
- **Box Props**: Added `id` property to track individual boxes
- **BoxSpawner**: Passes unique IDs to each Box component
- **Hook Integration**: `useCrateFull` now reads from global state

## Technical Implementation

### Files Modified
- **app/hooks/useCrateFull.ts**: Complete rewrite to use global state
- **app/components/BoxSpawner.tsx**: Added ID tracking and position monitoring

### Key Changes
- Removed dependency on deprecated `useWorld` API
- Created robust position tracking system
- Maintained all existing functionality
- Improved performance by tracking only relevant boxes

### API Compatibility
- **Current Version**: Works with latest `@react-three/cannon`
- **React 19**: Fully compatible with React 19
- **Three.js**: Compatible with latest Three.js ecosystem

## Benefits
- **Stability**: No more crashes from deprecated API calls
- **Accuracy**: Real-time tracking of actual box positions
- **Performance**: Efficient tracking of only relevant boxes
- **Maintainability**: Clean, modern API usage

## Testing
- Packing tetris game should now load without errors
- Crate fullness detection should work correctly
- Box spawning and physics should function normally
- Camera animations should trigger when crate is full
