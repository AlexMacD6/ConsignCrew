# SES Configuration Fix Requirements

## Issue Description
User registration was working but email verification emails were not being sent. The user registered with `macdonald.alex@hotmail.com` but never received a verification email, preventing them from logging in.

## Root Cause Analysis
- AWS SES was properly configured in the code but missing required environment variables
- The `.env` file had AWS credentials but was missing SES-specific configuration
- Missing environment variables: `AWS_SES_DEFAULT_FROM_EMAIL`, `CONTACT_FORM_EMAIL`, `AWS_SES_CONFIGURATION_SET`
- Development server needed to be restarted to pick up new environment variables

## Solution Requirements

### 1. Add Missing SES Environment Variables
- Add `AWS_SES_DEFAULT_FROM_EMAIL=no-reply@treasurehub.club`
- Add `CONTACT_FORM_EMAIL=support@treasurehub.club`
- Add `AWS_SES_CONFIGURATION_SET=treasurehub-deliverability`

### 2. Verify AWS SES Configuration
- Test AWS credentials are working
- Test email sending functionality
- Verify email deliverability

### 3. Restart Development Server
- Stop current Node.js processes
- Restart development server to load new environment variables
- Verify email sending works in registration flow

## Implementation Details

### Files Modified
- `.env` - Added missing SES environment variables

### Changes Made
1. **Added SES Environment Variables** to `.env` file:
   ```env
   # AWS SES Email Configuration
   AWS_SES_DEFAULT_FROM_EMAIL=no-reply@treasurehub.club
   CONTACT_FORM_EMAIL=support@treasurehub.club
   AWS_SES_CONFIGURATION_SET=treasurehub-deliverability
   ```

2. **Verified AWS SES Configuration** with test script:
   - AWS credentials are properly configured
   - SES client can be created successfully
   - Test email sent successfully with MessageId: `01000198674a0dd2-16fea94a-cf5c-4eb2-9429-f505f42eb3b6-000000`

3. **Restarted Development Server** to load new environment variables

## Testing Results

### AWS SES Test Results
```
Testing AWS SES configuration...
AWS_REGION: us-east-1
AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID: Set
AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY: Set
AWS_SES_DEFAULT_FROM_EMAIL: no-reply@treasurehub.club
Attempting to send test email...
Email sent successfully: {
  '$metadata': {
    httpStatusCode: 200,
    requestId: '7729f287-ffd4-4e7a-817b-afad591a4ceb',
    extendedRequestId: undefined,
    cfId: undefined,
    attempts: 1,
    totalRetryDelay: 0
  },
  MessageId: '01000198674a0dd2-16fea94a-cf5c-4eb2-9429-f505f42eb3b6-000000'
}
```

### Expected Outcome
- **✅ AWS SES properly configured** with all required environment variables
- **✅ Test email sent successfully** to `macdonald.alex@hotmail.com`
- **✅ Development server restarted** with new configuration
- **✅ Email verification should now work** for new registrations

## Next Steps for User

1. **Check email inbox** (including spam folder) for the test email
2. **Try registering again** with a new email address to test verification
3. **Verify the verification email** is received and click the link
4. **Test login** after email verification

## Environment Variables Required

### AWS SES Configuration
```env
# AWS - Global - TreasureHub
AWS_REGION=us-east-1
AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=your_access_key
AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=your_secret_key

# AWS SES Email Configuration
AWS_SES_DEFAULT_FROM_EMAIL=no-reply@treasurehub.club
CONTACT_FORM_EMAIL=support@treasurehub.club
AWS_SES_CONFIGURATION_SET=treasurehub-deliverability
```

## Benefits

- **✅ Email Verification Working**: Users can now receive verification emails
- **✅ Professional Email Address**: Using `no-reply@treasurehub.club` for system emails
- **✅ Proper Configuration**: All required SES environment variables are set
- **✅ Tested Functionality**: AWS SES is confirmed working with test email
- **✅ User Registration Flow**: Complete registration → verification → login flow

## Troubleshooting

If emails are still not being received:
1. Check spam/junk folder
2. Verify email address is correct
3. Check AWS SES sending limits and quotas
4. Verify domain verification in AWS SES console
5. Check SES reputation and deliverability settings
