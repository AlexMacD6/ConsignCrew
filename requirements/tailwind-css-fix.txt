# Tailwind CSS Fix Requirements

## Problem
- Tailwind CSS globals.css code appeared to be deleted or not applied after removing Vite
- Potential configuration issues with Tailwind CSS setup

## Issues Identified and Fixed

### 1. Duplicate PostCSS Configuration Files
- **Issue**: Both `postcss.config.js` and `postcss.config.mjs` existed, causing conflicts
- **Solution**: Removed `postcss.config.js` and kept `postcss.config.mjs` for consistency

### 2. Incorrect Tailwind Content Paths
- **Issue**: Tailwind config was looking for components in `./components/**/*` but components are in `./app/components/**/*`
- **Solution**: Updated `tailwind.config.ts` content paths to include `./app/components/**/*.{js,ts,jsx,tsx,mdx}`

### 3. Missing Tailwind Animation Plugin
- **Issue**: `tailwindcss-animate` plugin was referenced in config but not installed
- **Solution**: Installed `tailwindcss-animate` package

## Files Modified
- **Deleted**: `postcss.config.js` (duplicate)
- **Updated**: `tailwind.config.ts` (content paths)
- **Added**: `tailwindcss-animate` dependency

## Verification
- Development server runs successfully on localhost:3000
- Tailwind classes are being applied in components (NavBar, main page)
- globals.css file is complete and properly structured
- PostCSS configuration is clean and consistent

## Current Status
✅ Tailwind CSS is properly configured and working
✅ All custom CSS variables and brand colors are defined
✅ Components are using Tailwind classes correctly
✅ No configuration conflicts remain
