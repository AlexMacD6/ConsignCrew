Landing Page Hero Section Reconstruction

**Objective:**
Reconstruct the landing page hero section to immediately capture buyers with why they should shop here now, replacing the video with a rotating carousel of listing hero photos.

**Requirements Implemented:**

### 1. Above-the-Fold (Hero Section) Purpose
- **Immediate Buyer Capture**: Focus on why buyers should shop here now
- **Visual Appeal**: Replace YouTube embedded video with rotating image carousel
- **Clear Value Proposition**: Emphasize curated goods, verified quality, and delivery

### 2. Content Structure

#### **Headline:**
- "Houston's Treasure Chest" - Main attention-grabbing title
- Kept the built-in Houston stamp in the same position (top-right)
- Large, bold typography with treasure color accent

#### **Subheadline:**
- "Curated goods. Verified quality. Delivered to your door."
- Clear, concise value proposition
- Emphasizes three key benefits

#### **Primary CTA:**
- "Shop Early Access Deals" - Direct action for buyers
- Large, prominent button with treasure color scheme
- Links to listings page

#### **Secondary CTA (Subtle Seller Hint):**
- "Want to sell with us soon? Join our seller list"
- Uses existing CTA email sign-up list functionality
- Secondary button styling to not compete with primary CTA

### 3. Visual Implementation

#### **Image Carousel:**
- **Replaced**: YouTube embedded video
- **New**: Dynamic carousel of actual listings for sale
- **Features**: Auto-play, navigation arrows, dots indicator, play/pause control
- **Images**: Real listing photos from the database
- **Content**: Shows actual item titles, prices, categories, and neighborhoods

#### **Carousel Features:**
- Auto-rotation every 5 seconds
- Pause on hover for better user control
- Navigation arrows and dots for manual control

- Smooth transitions between images
- Responsive design for mobile and desktop

### 4. Technical Implementation
