# 3D Landing Page Implementation Requirements

## Problem
- Replace the existing static landing page with an interactive 3D experience
- Create a modern, engaging landing page that showcases ConsignCrew's innovative approach
- Improve user engagement and visual appeal

## Solution Implemented

### 1. New Landing Page Structure
- **3D Background Scene**: Full-screen Three.js canvas as background
- **Content Overlay**: Modern glassmorphism UI elements over the 3D scene
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-first approach with responsive breakpoints
- **Interactive Elements**: Hover effects, animations, and smooth transitions

### 2. ThreeScene Component Features
- **Floating Boxes**: Animated 3D boxes in brand colors (#D4AF3D, #825E08)
- **Particle System**: Dynamic particle effects with 500 animated particles
- **Stars Background**: Realistic star field for depth
- **Lighting System**: Ambient, directional, and point lights for realistic rendering
- **Auto-rotation**: Subtle camera movement for dynamic feel
- **Wireframe Elements**: Large background wireframe boxes for visual interest

### 3. UI/UX Improvements
- **Glassmorphism Design**: Semi-transparent backgrounds with backdrop blur
- **Brand Colors**: Consistent use of ConsignCrew gold (#D4AF3D) and dark brown (#825E08)
- **Typography**: Large, bold headlines with proper contrast
- **Form Design**: Modern input fields with focus states
- **Button Interactions**: Hover effects and scale animations
- **Loading States**: Smooth loading spinner for 3D scene

### 4. Performance Optimizations
- **Dynamic Imports**: ThreeScene loaded dynamically to avoid SSR issues
- **Suspense Boundaries**: Proper loading states and fallbacks
- **Optimized Animations**: Efficient use of useFrame for smooth performance
- **Responsive 3D**: Canvas adapts to different screen sizes

## Technical Implementation

### Files Created/Modified
- **app/page.tsx**: Completely redesigned landing page
- **app/components/ThreeScene.tsx**: New 3D scene component
- **app/globals.css**: Added custom animations and keyframes

### Key Features
