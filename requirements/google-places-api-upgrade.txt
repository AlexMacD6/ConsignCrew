Google Places API Upgrade and Form Data Transfer Fix

Requirements:
- Upgrade Google Places API from deprecated Autocomplete class to recommended PlaceAutocompleteElement Web Component
- Fix form data transfer issue where updated address data was not displaying on profile page after selection
- Ensure address dropdown populates correctly when typing in street address field
- Handle Google's deprecation policy for new customers (Autocomplete not available after March 1st, 2025)

Technical Changes:
1. AddressAutocomplete Component (app/components/AddressAutocomplete.tsx):
   - Replace google.maps.places.Autocomplete with google.maps.places.PlaceAutocompleteElement Web Component
   - Use Google Maps API v=beta for Web Component support
   - Implement proper Web Component event handling (gmp-placeselect, gmp-placechange)
   - Create and configure <gmp-place-autocomplete> element dynamically
   - Handle address component parsing from Web Component response
   - Add proper error handling and loading states

2. Profile Page (app/profile/page.tsx):
   - Update AddressAutocomplete component usage to match new interface
   - Remove onChange prop (no longer needed with Web Component approach)
   - Ensure handleAddressSelect properly updates form state and triggers re-render
   - Fix HTML structure to prevent hydration errors (replace <p> with <div> tags)

3. TypeScript Types (types/google-maps.d.ts):
   - Remove old Google Maps API class declarations that caused type conflicts
   - Add JSX intrinsic elements declaration for gmp-place-autocomplete Web Component
   - Provide proper TypeScript support for Web Component attributes and events

4. API Version:
   - Use Google Maps API v=beta for PlaceAutocompleteElement support
   - Configure Web Component with proper attributes (types, component-restrictions)
   - Handle both gmp-placeselect and gmp-placechange events for compatibility

Dependencies:
- Google Maps JavaScript API (v=beta)
- Next.js environment variables for API key configuration
- Lucide React for loading spinner icon

Testing:
- Verify address dropdown populates when typing in street address field
- Confirm selected address data transfers to all form fields (street, city, state, zip, country)
- Test error handling for API loading failures
- Validate form data persistence and display on profile page
- Check for hydration errors and TypeScript compilation issues

Notes:
- PlaceAutocompleteElement is a Web Component (<gmp-place-autocomplete>) not a class
- Previous InvalidValueError was due to incorrect instantiation approach
- Web Component approach provides better performance and future compatibility
- Beta API version required for Web Component support
