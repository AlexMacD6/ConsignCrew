# Listing Detail Page API Fix

## Problem
- Listing detail page was showing "Failed to fetch listing" error
- API endpoint was searching by database `id` field instead of `itemId` field
- Data transformation was missing between API response and frontend expectations

## Changes Made

### 1. Fixed API Endpoint Search Field
- **File**: `app/api/listings/[id]/route.ts`
- **Change**: Updated search from `id: id` to `itemId: id`
- **Reason**: URL parameter contains the human-readable `itemId`, not the database CUID

### 2. Added Data Transformation
- **File**: `app/(dashboard)/list-item/[id]/page.tsx`
- **Change**: Added comprehensive data transformation from API response to frontend format
- **Includes**: 
  - Converting `itemId` to `item_id`
  - Transforming photo structure
  - Adding missing fields with default values
  - Handling user and organization data

### 3. Improved Error Handling
- **File**: `app/api/listings/[id]/route.ts`
- **Change**: Added more specific error message showing the itemId being searched
- **File**: `app/(dashboard)/list-item/[id]/page.tsx`
- **Change**: Removed fallback to mock data, now shows proper error state

### 4. Maintained Rating Display Fix
- **Ensured**: Rating display logic remains consistent with previous fix
- **Condition**: Only shows ratings when `rating && reviews > 0`

## Testing Instructions
1. Navigate to listings page
2. Click "View Details" on any listing
3. Verify the detail page loads correctly
4. Check that rating only shows when there are actual reviews
5. Test with invalid itemId to ensure proper error handling
