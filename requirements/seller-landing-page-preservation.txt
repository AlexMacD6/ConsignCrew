### 2. Original Hero Section Content
- **Headline**: "Sell Stress-Free" (seller-focused)
- **Subheadline**: "Turn clutter into cash without the hassle"
- **Video**: YouTube embedded video showing "How Easy It Is To Get Paid"
- **Features List**: 
  - Automatically generated listings
  - Set discount schedules
  - Concierge pick-up/delivery
  - Instant payouts

### 5. Key Differences from New Landing Page

#### **Hero Section:**

- **New**: "Houston's Treasure Chest" + Image Carousel + Buyer focus

#### **Primary CTA:**
- **Old**: "Get Early Access" (seller signup)
- **New**: "Shop Early Access Deals" (buyer action)

#### **Secondary CTA:**
- **Old**: None (single focus on seller signup)
- **New**: "Join our seller list" (subtle seller invitation)

#### **Visual Content:**
- **Old**: YouTube video explaining selling process
- **New**: Rotating carousel of actual listings for sale

### 6. Usage Scenarios

#### **Immediate Use:**
- **Testing**: Compare conversion rates between seller vs. buyer focus

#### **Future Use:**

### 7. Navigation Integration
