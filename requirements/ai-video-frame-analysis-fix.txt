# AI Video Frame Analysis and Dimension Parsing Fix

## Problem
The AI was not properly analyzing video keyframes and was returning non-numeric values for dimensions (e.g., "Approximately 48 inches" instead of "48"), causing form parsing errors.

## Issues Identified
1. **Video keyframes not being analyzed**: AI prompt wasn't explicit enough about analyzing video frames
2. **Non-numeric dimensions**: AI was returning descriptive text instead of exact numbers
3. **Missing video analysis in descriptions**: AI wasn't mentioning video observations in descriptions
4. **Video frame URLs not being passed correctly**: Video processing modal was expecting wrong data structure from API

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Enhanced AI Prompt
- Added explicit instructions to analyze video keyframes at specific timestamps (0%, 10%, 25%, 50%, 90%)
- Required AI to mention video observations in detailed descriptions
- Added critical requirements section for exact numerical values

### 2. Dimension Requirements
- **EXACT NUMERICAL VALUES ONLY**: AI must return "48" not "Approximately 48 inches"
- Clear instruction to use null if dimensions cannot be determined
- Prevents form parsing errors

### 3. Video Analysis Integration
- AI must explicitly mention video frame observations in descriptions
- Enhanced understanding of product functionality through video analysis
- Cross-reference visual findings with user-provided information

### 4. Video Frame URL Fix
- Fixed video processing modal to correctly extract frame URLs from API response
- Updated data structure mapping: `statusData.urls.frames` instead of `statusData.frameUrls`
- Ensured proper thumbnail and duration data extraction

## Technical Changes
- Updated `app/api/ai/generate-comprehensive-listing/route.ts`
- Enhanced prompt with critical requirements section
- Added explicit video frame analysis instructions
- Required exact numerical values for dimensions
- Fixed `app/components/VideoProcessingModal.tsx` to correctly extract video frame URLs
- Updated data structure mapping for video processing completion

## Testing
- Verify AI analyzes video keyframes when available
- Confirm dimensions are returned as exact numbers
- Check that video observations are mentioned in descriptions
- Ensure form inputs can parse dimension values without errors

## Dependencies
- Video upload and processing system must be working
- FFmpeg must be installed for video frame extraction
- CloudFront URLs must be accessible to OpenAI API
