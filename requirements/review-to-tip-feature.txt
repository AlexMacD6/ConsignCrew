Review-to-Tip Feature Requirements for TreasureHub Deliveries

CONCEPT:
Each driver carries small cards with QR codes. When customers scan them, they're redirected to TreasureHub's Google Reviews page. We track which driver's QR was scanned and award bonuses for verified 5-star reviews.

DRIVER MESSAGE:
"If you feel that we have exceeded your expectations, we don't take tips. That's part of the concierge delivery service. However, for every ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ Google review that I get, TreasureHub will tip me."

QR CODE URL FORMAT:
treasurehub.club/review/[DRIVER_INITIALS]
