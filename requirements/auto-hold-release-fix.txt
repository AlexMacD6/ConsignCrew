# Automatic Hold Release Fix

## Problem
Listings were getting stuck in "processing" status for hours even after their `heldUntil` timestamp had expired. The system had cleanup endpoints but no automatic mechanism to release holds when they expired.

## CRITICAL ISSUE DISCOVERED
⚠️ **EMERGENCY FIX APPLIED**: The initial implementation incorrectly released holds on ALL expired listings, including sold items. This caused sold listings to be re-listed as active, which is a critical business logic error.

## Root Cause
The system relied on manual cleanup calls or cron jobs to release expired holds, but:
1. No cron jobs were configured in `vercel.json`
2. No automatic triggers ran when `heldUntil` expired
3. Holds only got released when cleanup endpoints were manually called
4. **CRITICAL**: Initial fix didn't distinguish between expired checkout holds and legitimately sold items

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Auto-Release Library (`app/lib/auto-release-holds.ts`) - FIXED
Created a utility library that:
- **`autoReleaseExpiredHolds()`** - Releases expired holds ONLY for listings with PENDING orders (not sold items)
- **`checkAndReleaseListingHold(listingId)`** - Checks and releases a specific listing's hold (with sold item protection)
- **`withAutoHoldRelease(operation)`** - Middleware wrapper for operations

**CRITICAL SAFETY CHECKS ADDED**:
- ✅ Only processes listings with status 'active' or 'processing' (never 'sold')
- ✅ Checks for paid orders before releasing any hold
- ✅ Skips listings that have PAID/FINALIZED orders
- ✅ Logs when holds are skipped due to paid orders

### 2. Integration with Listing APIs
Updated listing endpoints to automatically check for expired holds:

**`app/api/listings/route.ts`** (GET listings):
```typescript
// Auto-release any expired holds before querying listings
await autoReleaseExpiredHolds();
```

**`app/api/listings/[id]/route.ts`** (GET single listing):
```typescript
// Check and release this specific listing's hold if expired
await checkAndReleaseListingHold(id);
```

### 3. Test Endpoint
Created `app/api/test/cleanup-holds/route.ts` for manual testing and verification.

### 4. Emergency Fix Endpoint - NEW
Created `app/api/admin/fix-sold-listings/route.ts` to:
- **GET**: Check which listings should be marked as sold but aren't
- **POST**: Fix listings that have paid orders but wrong status
- **Admin-only**: Requires admin authentication
- **Safe**: Creates history events for all corrections

## How It Works Now

### Automatic Release
- **Every time listings are queried**, expired holds are automatically released
- **When viewing a specific listing**, that listing's hold is checked and released if expired
- **Real-time processing** - no waiting for cron jobs or manual intervention

### Database Operations
```sql
-- Releases expired holds
UPDATE "Listing" 
SET "isHeld" = false, "heldUntil" = null, "status" = 'active'
WHERE "isHeld" = true AND "heldUntil" < NOW();

-- Cancels expired orders
UPDATE "orders"
SET "status" = 'CANCELLED', "isHeld" = false
WHERE "status" = 'PENDING' AND "isHeld" = true AND "checkoutExpiresAt" < NOW();
```

### Performance Considerations
- **Efficient queries** - Uses `updateMany` for batch operations
- **Minimal overhead** - Only runs when listings are accessed
- **Logging** - Logs when holds are released for monitoring

## Benefits

### For Users
- ✅ **No more stuck listings** - Holds release automatically when expired
- ✅ **Real-time availability** - Items become available immediately when holds expire
- ✅ **Consistent experience** - No manual intervention needed

### For System
- ✅ **Self-healing** - System automatically fixes stuck states
- ✅ **No cron dependency** - Works without external scheduling
- ✅ **Immediate effect** - Takes effect as soon as deployed

## Testing

### Manual Test
Call the test endpoint to verify cleanup works:
```bash
GET /api/test/cleanup-holds
```

### Automatic Test
- View any listing page - holds will be checked automatically
- Browse listings - expired holds will be released automatically

## Files Modified
- `app/lib/auto-release-holds.ts` (new)
- `app/api/listings/route.ts` (updated)
- `app/api/listings/[id]/route.ts` (updated)
- `app/api/test/cleanup-holds/route.ts` (new)

## Backward Compatibility
- ✅ All existing cleanup endpoints still work
- ✅ No database schema changes required
- ✅ No breaking changes to existing functionality
- ✅ Existing cron endpoints can still be used if desired

## Future Enhancements
- Could add database triggers for even more immediate release
- Could implement WebSocket notifications when holds are released
- Could add metrics/monitoring for hold release frequency
