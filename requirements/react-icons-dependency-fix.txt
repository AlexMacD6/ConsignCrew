# React Icons Dependency Fix Requirements

## Problem
- Module not found error for `react-icons/fa` in FAQ page
- FAQ page was trying to import FontAwesome icons that weren't installed
- Inconsistent icon library usage across the application

## Root Cause
- FAQ page was importing icons from `react-icons/fa` (FontAwesome)
- The `react-icons` package wasn't installed in the project
- Mixed usage of different icon libraries (react-icons vs lucide-react)

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Standardized Icon Library Usage
- **Removed**: `react-icons/fa` imports from FAQ page
- **Replaced**: All FontAwesome icons with equivalent Lucide React icons
- **Consistency**: Now using only `lucide-react` throughout the application

### 2. Icon Mappings
- `FaSearch` → `Search` (lucide-react)
- `FaChevronDown` → `ChevronDown` (lucide-react) - already in use
- `FaChevronRight` → `ChevronRight` (lucide-react) - not used in current code
- `FaThumbsUp` → `ThumbsUp` (lucide-react) - already in use
- `FaThumbsDown` → `ThumbsDown` (lucide-react) - already in use

### 3. Package Management
- **Installed**: `react-icons` package for future compatibility
- **Standardized**: Using `lucide-react` as the primary icon library
- **Cleanup**: Removed unused FontAwesome imports

## Technical Implementation

### Files Modified
- **app/faq/page.tsx**: Updated imports and icon usage

### Changes Made
- Removed FontAwesome icon imports
- Added `Search` icon import from lucide-react
- Replaced `FaSearch` with `Search` component
- Maintained all existing functionality

### Benefits
- **Consistency**: Single icon library across the application
- **Performance**: Reduced bundle size by using one icon library
- **Maintainability**: Easier to manage and update icons
- **Compatibility**: Works with React 19 and latest dependencies

## Icon Library Strategy
- **Primary**: `lucide-react` for all new icon needs
- **Fallback**: `react-icons` available if needed for specific icons
- **Consistency**: All components should use the same icon library

## Testing
- FAQ page should load without module resolution errors
- Search icon should display correctly in the search input
- All existing functionality should work as expected
- No visual regressions in the FAQ interface
