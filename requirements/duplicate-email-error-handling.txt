# Duplicate Email Error Handling Requirements

## Problem
- Users who have already signed up for early access don't receive clear feedback when they try to sign up again
- No error messages are displayed when duplicate emails are submitted
- Users may be confused about whether their signup was successful

## Solution
- Add error message handling for duplicate email submissions
- Display user-friendly messages when someone has already signed up
- Implement consistent error handling across all signup forms

## Implementation Details

### API Response Handling
- The `/api/subscribe` endpoint already returns `"Email already subscribed"` message for duplicate emails
- Frontend components need to check for this specific message and display appropriate error

### Error Message Display
- Show "You're already signed up! We'll notify you when we launch." for duplicate emails
- Display error messages in red text below the form
- Clear error messages when user starts typing again

### Components Updated
- **Hero Section Form**: Added error state and display
- **SignupModal**: Enhanced error handling for duplicate emails
- **Final CTA Section**: Added error and success message display

### User Experience Improvements
- Clear feedback for duplicate submissions
- Consistent messaging across all signup points
- Non-frustrating experience for returning users

## Files Modified
- app/page.tsx - Hero and final CTA forms
- app/components/SignupModal.tsx - Modal form

## Error Handling Flow
1. User submits email that already exists
2. API returns success with "Email already subscribed" message
3. Frontend checks for this specific message
4. Displays user-friendly error message
5. User understands they're already signed up

## Benefits
- Better user experience for returning visitors
- Clear communication about signup status
- Reduced confusion and support requests
- Professional error handling throughout the application
