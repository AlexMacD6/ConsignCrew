# Meta Pixel Error Fix Requirements

## Issue Description
The application was experiencing a JavaScript error: "Uncaught TypeError: window.fbq is not a function" when trying to track Meta Pixel events. This error occurred because the Meta Pixel script was not fully loaded before tracking functions were called.

## Root Cause
- Race condition between Meta Pixel script loading and event tracking calls
- No proper error handling or initialization checks
- Tracking functions were called before the `fbq` function was available on the window object

## Solution Requirements

### 1. Improve Meta Pixel Initialization
- Add proper async initialization with Promise-based loading
- Implement initialization state tracking to prevent multiple initialization attempts
- Add error handling for script loading failures
- Ensure the `fbq` function is available before any tracking calls

### 2. Update Tracking Functions
- Make all tracking functions async to wait for initialization
- Add proper checks to ensure Meta Pixel is ready before tracking
- Implement graceful fallback when Meta Pixel is not available
- Add error handling for tracking failures

### 3. Update MetaPixelProvider Component
- Add `isReady` state to track initialization status
- Handle async initialization properly
- Provide initialization status to consuming components
- Ensure all tracking functions are async

### 4. Update Page Components
- Check Meta Pixel readiness before calling tracking functions
- Handle async tracking calls properly
- Add proper error handling for tracking failures

## Implementation Details

### Files Modified
- `app/lib/meta-pixel.ts` - Core Meta Pixel utility functions
- `app/components/MetaPixelProvider.tsx` - React provider component
- `app/page.tsx` - Main page with tracking calls

### Key Changes
1. **Async Initialization**: Meta Pixel now initializes asynchronously with proper Promise handling
2. **State Management**: Added global state tracking for initialization status
3. **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling for script loading and tracking failures
4. **Ready State**: Added `isReady` property to check if Meta Pixel is available
5. **Graceful Degradation**: App continues to work even if Meta Pixel fails to load

## Testing Instructions
1. Load the application and check browser console for Meta Pixel errors
2. Verify that Meta Pixel events are tracked properly when the pixel ID is configured
3. Test that the app works normally when Meta Pixel is not configured
4. Check that tracking functions don't throw errors when Meta Pixel is unavailable

## Environment Variables
Ensure the following environment variables are properly configured:
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_META_PIXEL_ID` - Your Meta Pixel ID
- `META_ACCESS_TOKEN` - Meta API access token for server-side events
- `META_API_VERSION` - Meta API version (default: v18.0)

## Expected Outcome
- No more "window.fbq is not a function" errors
- Meta Pixel events track properly when configured
- Application continues to function normally regardless of Meta Pixel status
- Improved error handling and user experience
