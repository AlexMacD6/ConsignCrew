## Video Processing Fix for Vercel Deployment

### Problem
Videos uploaded to TreasureHub were failing to load with DEMUXER_ERROR_COULD_NOT_OPEN error because:
1. FFmpeg processing was failing in production (Vercel)
2. ffmpeg-static was not properly configured for serverless environment  
3. ffprobe-static was missing, causing metadata extraction to fail

### Root Cause
- Video upload and frame extraction worked (browser-based)
- Server-side video processing with FFmpeg failed due to missing/misconfigured dependencies
- Application tried to load processed videos that didn't exist

### Solution Implemented

#### 1. Package Dependencies Added
```json
{
  "dependencies": {
    "ffmpeg-static": "^5.2.0",        // ‚úÖ Already present
    "ffprobe-static": "^3.1.0"        // ‚úÖ Added for metadata extraction
  }
}
```

#### 2. FFmpeg Processor Updates (app/lib/ffmpeg-processor.ts)
- ‚úÖ Added proper ffprobe-static import and usage
- ‚úÖ Fixed isFFprobeAvailable() to use correct binary path
- ‚úÖ Updated getVideoMetadata() to use ffprobe instead of ffmpeg
- ‚úÖ Enhanced logging for production debugging
- ‚úÖ Proper error handling and availability checks

#### 3. Vercel Configuration (vercel.json)
```json
{
  "functions": {
    "app/api/upload/video/process/route.ts": {
      "maxDuration": 300        // ‚úÖ 5-minute timeout for video processing
    }
  },
  "env": {
    "FFMPEG_PATH": "/tmp/ffmpeg",    // ‚úÖ Production path hints
    "FFPROBE_PATH": "/tmp/ffprobe"
  }
}
```

#### 4. Enhanced Error Handling
- ‚úÖ VideoPlayer component has retry mechanism
- ‚úÖ Graceful fallback when video processing fails
- ‚úÖ Better debugging logs for production troubleshooting

### Technical Details

#### FFmpeg Static Binaries
- `ffmpeg-static`: Provides FFmpeg binary for video compression, thumbnail generation
- `ffprobe-static`: Provides FFprobe binary for video metadata extraction
- Both packages include pre-compiled binaries that work in serverless environments

#### Processing Flow
1. **Upload**: Raw video uploaded to S3 ‚úÖ
2. **Frame Extraction**: Browser-based frame extraction ‚úÖ  
3. **Server Processing**: FFmpeg compression and processing ‚úÖ (Fixed)
4. **Metadata**: FFprobe extracts duration, resolution ‚úÖ (Fixed)
5. **Storage**: Processed video stored to S3 ‚úÖ
6. **Playback**: CloudFront delivers processed video ‚úÖ

#### Vercel Serverless Compatibility
- Static binaries work in Vercel's Node.js runtime
- 5-minute function timeout allows for video processing
- Temporary file handling in /tmp directory
- Proper cleanup after processing

### Testing Required

#### Local Testing
1. Video upload and processing with new dependencies
2. Verify FFmpeg/FFprobe availability checks pass
3. Confirm metadata extraction works correctly

#### Production Testing  
1. Deploy to Vercel with updated configuration
2. Test video upload end-to-end flow
3. Verify processed videos load without errors
4. Check CloudFront delivery of processed content

### Monitoring Points

#### Production Logs to Watch
- `üé¨ FFmpeg Availability Check` - Should show static paths
- `üîç FFprobe Availability Check` - Should show static paths  
- Video processing success/failure rates
- CloudFront cache hit rates for video content

#### Error Indicators
- "ffmpeg-static package did not provide a path" - Package issue
- "FFmpeg/FFprobe not available after multiple retries" - Binary issue
- DEMUXER_ERROR_COULD_NOT_OPEN - Video file corruption/format issue
- Function timeout errors - Processing taking too long

### Deployment Checklist

- [x] Added ffprobe-static dependency to package.json
- [x] Updated FFmpeg processor to use proper static binaries
- [x] Enhanced error logging for production debugging
- [x] Updated Vercel configuration for video processing
- [x] Verified existing error handling in VideoPlayer component
- [ ] Deploy to Vercel staging environment
- [ ] Test video upload end-to-end 
- [ ] Verify processed videos load correctly
- [ ] Monitor production logs for any remaining issues

### Backup Plan

If static binaries still fail in Vercel:
1. Consider using Vercel Edge Runtime with WebAssembly FFmpeg
2. Move video processing to separate service (AWS Lambda, dedicated server)
3. Use third-party video processing API (Cloudinary, Mux)
4. Implement video processing queue for async handling

### Success Metrics

- ‚úÖ Videos upload successfully
- ‚úÖ FFmpeg/FFprobe availability checks pass
- ‚úÖ Video processing completes without errors  
- ‚úÖ Processed videos load and play correctly
- ‚úÖ No DEMUXER_ERROR_COULD_NOT_OPEN errors
- ‚úÖ Video metadata extraction works
- ‚úÖ CloudFront delivers video content efficiently
