# Console Errors Fix Requirements

## Issues Identified

### 1. 401 Unauthorized Errors
- GET http://localhost:3000/api/profile 401 (Unauthorized)
- This occurs when trying to access the profile page without proper authentication
- The BetterAuth session is not being properly established or maintained

### 2. BetterAuth Social Provider Warnings
- Social provider google is missing clientId or clientSecret
- Social provider facebook is missing clientId or clientSecret  
- Social provider tiktok is missing clientId or clientSecret
- These warnings appear because OAuth credentials are not configured
