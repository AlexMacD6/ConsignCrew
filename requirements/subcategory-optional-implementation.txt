## Sub-Category Field Made Optional - Implementation Summary

### Problem
Some Facebook Marketplace categories do not have sub-categories, making the sub-category field mandatory was preventing users from posting listings in those categories.

### Solution
Made the sub-category field optional throughout the application.

### Changes Made

#### 1. Database Schema (prisma/schema.prisma)
- Changed `subCategory String` to `subCategory String?` in the Listing model
- Applied changes using `npx prisma db push`

#### 2. Frontend Validation (app/(dashboard)/list-item/page.tsx)
- Commented out sub-category requirement in `validateForm()` function
- Updated `isFormValid` calculation to not require sub-category
- Added explanatory comments about the change

#### 3. UI Components (app/components/CategorySelector.tsx)
- Updated label from "Sub-category *" to "Sub-category (optional)"
- Removed `required` attribute from the select element
- Updated placeholder text from "Select Sub-category" to "Select Sub-category (optional)"

#### 4. API Validation (app/api/listings/route.ts)
- No changes needed - API validation already doesn't require sub-category

### Benefits
- Users can now post listings for categories without sub-categories
- Better user experience - no confusing required fields for inapplicable categories
- Maintains data integrity - sub-category is still captured when available
- Backward compatible - existing listings with sub-categories remain unchanged

### Testing
- Verified database schema update successful
- Confirmed no TypeScript/linting errors
- Form validation now allows empty sub-category
- UI clearly indicates field is optional
