# WebGL Error Fix for ThreeScene Component

## Overview
Fix WebGL context creation errors in the ThreeScene component to provide a better user experience when WebGL is not supported or fails to initialize.

## Problem
- WebGL context creation failures causing console errors
- Poor fallback experience when 3D background fails to load
- Inconsistent error handling for different WebGL failure scenarios

## Changes Made

### Enhanced Error Detection
- Added comprehensive WebGL support detection before attempting to create context
- Implemented multiple fallback strategies for different WebGL failure types
- Added console error and warning interception to catch WebGL context creation failures
- Enhanced error handling for "Failed to create WebGL2RenderingContext" errors

### Improved ErrorFallback Component
- Updated branding from "ConsignCrew" to "TreasureHub"
- Enhanced visual design with gradient background and card layout
- Added TreasureHub logo to fallback screen
- Improved button styling with brand colors
- Better messaging and user experience

### Canvas Configuration Improvements
- Changed powerPreference from "high-performance" to "default" for better compatibility
- Added onCreated callback to confirm successful WebGL context creation
- Enhanced error callback with detailed logging
- Optimized WebGL context parameters for better stability

### Loading State Updates
- Updated loading spinner to use brand colors (treasure-500)
- Consistent styling with the rest of the application

## Files Modified
- app/components/ThreeScene.tsx

## Technical Details
- WebGL support detection checks for webgl2, webgl, and experimental-webgl contexts
- Error handling covers context creation failures, context loss, and general Three.js errors
- Fallback gracefully degrades to static background when WebGL is unavailable
- Retry mechanism with maximum 3 attempts before showing fallback

## User Experience Improvements
- Users with WebGL issues now see a branded, informative fallback screen
- Clear messaging about 3D background unavailability
- Option to retry 3D background loading (up to 3 attempts)
- Consistent visual design with the rest of the application
- No more console errors cluttering the browser console
