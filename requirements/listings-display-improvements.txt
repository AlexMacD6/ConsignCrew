# Listings Display Improvements Requirements

## 1. Information Hiding and Privacy
- Remove "ConsignCrew Fee" from listing display, show only at checkout
- Conceal "price range" and "reserve price" from listing, show "Reserve Met" note when list price is at or below reserve minimum
- Remove "Item ID" from listing display
- Conditionally display "Serial Number" or "Model Number" only if filled out

## 2. Enhanced Listing Information
- Display "time left before the next price drop" according to discount schedule
- Add "brand/manufacturer" information to listings
- Add "product dimensions" to listings
- Show estimated retail price with strikethrough, percentage off, and red downward arrow

## 3. UI Text Changes
- Change "Contact Seller" button to "Ask A Question"
- Make "Buy it Now" the main Call to Action
- Make "Ask a Question" button tiny with Question Mark icon

## 4. Gallery and Button Updates
- Remove "Approved Zone" comment from listing cards
- Remove "Classic-60" discount code tag
- Remove discount schedule tags from listings
- Remove ZIP codes from Gallery page
- Remove "Heart" functionality, keep only "Save" and "Hide"

## 5. List an Item Page Alignment
- Make "List an Item" page match required inputs for Listing details
- Show auto-generated fields on the left (read-only)
- Show editable fields on the right
- Include all new fields: brand, dimensions, serial/model numbers, estimated retail price, discount schedule
- Add tooltip with detailed discount schedule explanations (Turbo-30 vs Classic-60)

## 6. Listing Tags and Badges
- Add "Newly Listed" tag for items added in the last 7 days
- Add "Price Drop" tag for any price drops in the last 3 days

## 7. Questions and Answers System
- Add public "Questions component" below listing details in modal
- Include "Approve" button for Admin to release questions and answers publicly
- All questions/responses must be approved before being released
- Show different states: Pending Approval, Approved - Not Public, Public
- Admin can preview answers before making them public
- Display "ConsignCrew" as the responder for approved answers

## 8. AI Responses System
- Create SQL table `ai_responses` with specified schema
- Populate with initial data for AI-driven standard responses
- Support categories: Pickup & Delivery, Pricing & Offers, Item Details, Availability, Returns & Refunds, Buyer Support, Payment & Checkout, Delivery Updates, General, Trust & Safety

## Implementation Notes

- Admin approval functionality is mock-enabled for demonstration
- Newly Listed tag calculates based on creation date
- Price Drop tag uses mock data (30% chance) for demonstration
