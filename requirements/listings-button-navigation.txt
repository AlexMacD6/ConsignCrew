# Listings Button Navigation Requirements

## Overview
Add a "Listings" button beside the "Get Early Access" button in the navigation bar for non-authenticated users, allowing them to browse existing listings on the site.

## Requirements

### 1. Desktop Navigation
- Add "Listings" button beside "Get Early Access" button for non-authenticated users
- Use secondary button styling (`btn btn-secondary btn-md`) to differentiate from primary action
- Maintain existing "Get Early Access" button as primary action
- Ensure proper spacing and alignment between buttons

### 2. Mobile Navigation
- Add "Listings" link to mobile menu under "Pages" section
- Maintain consistent styling with other mobile menu items
- Ensure mobile menu closes when Listings link is clicked

### 3. Button Styling
- Use existing `btn-secondary` class for consistent styling
- Secondary button should have gray background with white text
- Hover effects should match existing button patterns
- Maintain responsive design across all screen sizes

### 4. User Experience
- Non-authenticated users can browse listings without signing up
- Authenticated users already have access to listings through existing navigation
- Maintain clear visual hierarchy with primary vs secondary actions
- Ensure smooth navigation experience
