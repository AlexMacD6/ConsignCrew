# Houston Stamp and Hero Text Update Requirements

## Problem
- Need to communicate that TreasureHub was built in Houston to users when they first arrive
- Current "Sell Stress-Free" text is split across two lines and needs to be on one line
- Early Access box needs cleanup and better messaging
- Demo Video pop-up in bottom right corner needs to be removed

## Solution
- Add a Houston stamp/badge to the hero component
- Modify the hero text layout to display "Sell Stress-Free" on one line
- Clean up Early Access box messaging
- Position Houston stamp after bullet points but before Early Access box
- Remove Demo Video pop-up from bottom right corner

## Implementation Details

### Houston Stamp
- Add a small, elegant badge/stamp indicating "Built in Houston" or "Houston, TX"
- Position it after the bullet points but before the Early Access box
- Use appropriate styling that fits with the existing design
- Consider using an icon (like a location pin) with the text
- Create a seal-like appearance with enhanced styling

### Hero Text Layout
- Modify the current flex layout for the logo and heading
- Ensure "Sell Stress-Free" appears on a single line
- Maintain responsive design for different screen sizes
- Keep the existing styling and animations

### Early Access Box Cleanup
- Put "Free Delivery for the First Month" together on one line
- Change "First 200 early access signups get" to "First 200 Early Access Sign-up Get: Only 200 Spots Remaining"
- Improve the messaging clarity and urgency

### Demo Video Pop-up Removal
- Remove DemoVideoBubble component import from main page
- Remove DemoVideoBubble component usage from page layout
- Clean up any related styling or dependencies

## Files to Modify
- app/page.tsx - Hero section layout and text, remove DemoVideoBubble
- app/components/EarlyAccessTracker.tsx - Early access box messaging

## Design Considerations
- Houston stamp should be subtle but visible
- Maintain the existing color scheme and typography
- Ensure the stamp doesn't interfere with the main call-to-action
- Keep the overall hero section balanced and visually appealing
- Early access messaging should be clear and create urgency
- Removing demo video pop-up creates cleaner, less cluttered interface
