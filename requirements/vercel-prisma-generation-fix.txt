Fix Prisma Client Generation Issue on Vercel

- Resolve PrismaClientInitializationError during Vercel build process
- Ensure Prisma client is properly generated before Next.js build
- Fix Vercel dependency caching issue with Prisma client
- Add proper build configuration for Vercel deployment

Root Cause:
- Vercel caches dependencies, causing outdated Prisma Client
- Prisma auto-generation isn't triggered during build process
- Build script needs explicit Prisma generation before Next.js build

Solution:
- Added prebuild script to package.json
- Created vercel.json configuration file
- Updated build command to ensure Prisma generation
- Enhanced database utility for better Vercel compatibility

Changes Made:
1. Added "prebuild": "prisma generate" to package.json scripts
2. Created vercel.json with explicit buildCommand
3. Updated database utility with connection pooling
4. Ensured immediate Prisma client initialization

Expected Result:
- Prisma client will be generated before Next.js build
- Build process will complete successfully
- API routes will work properly in production
