## Additional Updates

### Hero Section Video Integration
- Added video demonstration to the left of Hero text on landing page
- Video source: YouTube embed (https://youtu.be/E-YgSpgl6M0)
- Implemented responsive 5-column grid layout (video: 3 columns, text: 2 columns) for better video prominence
- Video behavior: Autoplay once, muted, with controls for user interaction
- Added aesthetic enhancements:
  - Rounded corners and shadow effects
  - Brand color gradient background
  - Decorative animated elements
  - YouTube embed with optimized parameters (autoplay, mute, controls enabled, modest branding)
  - Proper aspect ratio (16:9) with minimum height (400px) for consistent sizing
  - No black edges - video fills container properly
- Updated layout from centered single-column to responsive grid
- Enhanced visual hierarchy with staggered animations
- **Performance benefit**: YouTube's global CDN provides faster video loading than local file hosting
- **User experience**: Video plays once automatically, users can click to replay

### Typography Consistency Improvements
- Increased font sizes in "Why TreasureHub" cards for better readability
- Updated card titles from `text-2xl` to `text-2xl lg:text-3xl` for responsive sizing
- Updated card content from `text-sm` to `text-base lg:text-lg` for consistency with main landing page
- Improved bullet point spacing from `space-y-1` to `space-y-2` for better visual hierarchy
- Enhanced overall spacing from `space-y-2` to `space-y-3` for better content breathing room
- **Consistency**: All components now use consistent font sizing patterns throughout the landing page

### Icon Enhancements
- Increased icon sizes in "Why TreasureHub" cards from `w-16 h-16` to `w-32 h-32` (doubled in size)
- Changed icon color from `text-treasure-500` to `text-black` for better contrast and visibility
- **Visual impact**: Larger, more prominent icons create stronger visual hierarchy and brand presence

### Navigation and Call-to-Action Updates
- **Hidden Login/Register buttons**: Removed Log In and Register buttons from navigation bar for non-authenticated users
- **Added "Get Early Access" button**: Replaced login/register with single "Get Early Access" button that opens email signup modal
- **Created SignupModal component**: New modal component with email input, success state, and smooth animations
- **Updated navigation links**: Changed navigation to scroll to landing page sections instead of external pages:
  - "How It Works" → scrolls to `#how-it-works` section
  - "Pricing" → scrolls to `#pricing` section  
  - "Why TreasureHub" → scrolls to `#why-treasurehub` section
  - "Roadmap" → scrolls to `#roadmap` section
  - "FAQ" → remains as external link to `/faq` page
- **Added section IDs**: Added corresponding IDs to landing page sections for smooth scrolling
- **Single call-to-action focus**: All user interactions now funnel to email signup for early access

## Notes
- CSS classes with "consigncrew" in the name (like "consigncrew-gold") were left unchanged as they are styling classes
- Configuration files like env.example and aws-iam-policy.json were not modified as they contain environment-specific settings
- Generated CSS files (out.css, globals.output.css) were not modified as they are build artifacts
