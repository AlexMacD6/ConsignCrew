# Address Completion Modal for Profile Page

## Problem
Users navigating to their profile page without a complete address cannot complete purchases on TreasureHub. We need to prompt them to add their address information to enable smooth checkout experiences.

## Requirements

### 1. Address Completion Detection
- Check if user has incomplete address information when they navigate to their profile
- Required address fields: addressLine1, city, state, zipCode
- Modal should only appear if any of these required fields are missing

### 2. Modal Design and UX
- Professional modal design with TreasureHub branding (#D4AF3D)
- Clear messaging about why address is needed for purchases
- MapPin icon to visually represent address completion
- Two action buttons: "Add Address Now" and "Skip for Now"
- Modal appears 1 second after profile page loads to ensure smooth UX

### 3. User Actions
- **Add Address Now**: Closes completion modal and opens existing AddressModal
- **Skip for Now**: Dismisses modal and allows user to continue
- **Address Addition**: When user successfully adds address, completion modal is dismissed
- User can still access address editing through existing "Edit Address" button

### 4. Integration with Existing Address System
- Leverages existing AddressModal component for address input
- Uses existing address validation and saving logic
- Maintains current address display and editing functionality
- No disruption to existing address management workflow

## Implementation Details

### Files Modified
- `app/profile/page.tsx` - Added address completion modal functionality

### Key Features Added
1. **Address Validation Function**: `isAddressIncomplete()` checks required fields
2. **Modal State Management**: `showAddressCompletionModal` state variable
3. **Automatic Modal Trigger**: Shows modal when user has incomplete address
4. **Seamless Integration**: Connects to existing AddressModal workflow
5. **Success Handling**: Auto-dismisses completion modal when address is saved

### User Flow
1. User navigates to profile page
2. System checks if address is incomplete
3. If incomplete, modal appears after 1-second delay
4. User can choose to add address now or skip
5. If "Add Address Now" is clicked, existing address modal opens
6. When address is successfully saved, completion modal is dismissed
7. User can continue using profile page normally

## Benefits
- **Improved Conversion**: Guides users to complete necessary purchase information
- **Better UX**: Clear explanation of why address is needed
- **Non-Intrusive**: Can be skipped if user isn't ready
- **Seamless Integration**: Uses existing address management system
- **Purchase Readiness**: Ensures users can complete checkout when they find items

## Testing Instructions
1. Create a user account without complete address information
2. Navigate to profile page
3. Verify completion modal appears after brief delay
4. Test "Add Address Now" button opens address modal
5. Test "Skip for Now" dismisses modal
6. Add a complete address and verify completion modal doesn't appear again
7. Verify existing address editing functionality still works normally
