Houston Stamp Image Update Requirements

## Overview
Replace the built-in Houston stamp with a custom image file and position it to the right of the bullet points in the hero component without affecting text formatting.

## Problem
- Current Houston stamp uses inline SVG and text styling
- Need to use the custom image file: `built_in_houston_top_right.png`
- Image should be positioned to the right of the 4 bullet points
- Text formatting should not be impacted by the image placement

## Solution
- Replace the current Houston stamp implementation with the custom image
- Use absolute positioning to overlay the image without affecting text layout
- Position the image to the right of the bullet points
- Ensure responsive sizing across different screen sizes

## Implementation Details

### Image Replacement
- Remove the current Houston stamp div with SVG icon and text
- Add the custom image using the `img` tag
- Source: `/built_in_houston_top_right.png`
- Alt text: "Built in Houston, TX"

### Positioning Strategy
- Use absolute positioning to overlay the image
- Add `relative` positioning to the parent container (`max-w-2xl`)
- Position the image at `top-4 right-0` with transform adjustments
- Use `z-10` to ensure the image appears above other content

### Responsive Sizing
- Small screens: `w-20 h-20` (80px x 80px)
- Medium screens: `w-24 h-24` (96px x 96px)
- Large screens: `w-28 h-28` (112px x 112px)
- Use `object-contain` to maintain aspect ratio

### Styling
- Add `drop-shadow-lg` for visual depth
- Use `transform translate-x-4 -translate-y-2` for fine-tuned positioning
- Ensure the image doesn't interfere with text readability

## Files Modified
- `app/page.tsx` - Hero section layout and Houston stamp implementation

## Technical Specifications

### CSS Classes Used
- `absolute top-4 right-0` - Positioning
- `transform translate-x-4 -translate-y-2` - Fine adjustment
- `z-10` - Layering
- `w-20 h-20 sm:w-24 sm:h-24 lg:w-28 lg:h-28` - Responsive sizing
- `object-contain` - Maintain aspect ratio
- `drop-shadow-lg` - Visual enhancement

### Parent Container Changes
- Added `relative` positioning to the `max-w-2xl` container

## Testing Considerations
