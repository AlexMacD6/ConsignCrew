# Listings Questions & Answers System Requirements

## 1. Public Q&A Display
- All questions and answers for a specific listing are displayed publicly below the listing details (in the modal or on the listing page).
- Only approved questions and answers are visible to the public.

## 2. Admin Approval Workflow
- All submitted questions and answers must be approved by an Admin before being released to the public.
- An "Approve" button is available for Admins to release Q&A pairs.
- Unapproved questions/answers are visible only to Admins (not to the seller or public).
- Status badges indicate whether a Q&A is pending, approved (not public), or public.

## 3. User Question Submission
- Users can submit new questions for any listing via a form below the Q&A section.
- Submitted questions are not visible to anyone except Admins until approved.
- Optionally, notify sellers/admins when a new question is submitted.

## 4. Persistence & Backend
- All questions and answers are stored in the database (e.g., Prisma model: `Question`).
- Fields include: `id`, `listing_id`, `question`, `answer`, `is_approved`, `is_public`, `created_by`, `created_at`, `answered_by`, `answered_at`, `approved_by`, `approved_at`.
- API endpoints for:
  - Submitting a question
  - Posting an answer (by seller or admin)
  - Approving a Q&A (admin only)
  - Fetching public Q&A for a listing
  - Fetching pending Q&A (admin only)

## 5. Admin Restriction
- Only users with the Admin role can:
  - View pending/unapproved questions
  - Approve questions/answers
  - See the "Approve" button
- All other users (including sellers) see only approved/public Q&A.

## 6. Optional Enhancements
- Allow sellers to answer questions, with admin approval required before public release.
- Log who approved each Q&A for audit purposes.
- Notify users when their question is answered and approved.

## 7. Implementation Notes
- UI should clearly distinguish between public and pending Q&A.
- Responsive design for all Q&A components.
- All changes should be tracked in this requirements file and referenced in PR templates. 

- Add the QuestionsDisplay component to the listing pages below the listing details for each item.
- Add a "See More" button to each listing modal that navigates to a dedicated listing page (item profile) for that item.
- Ensure the QR code for each item redirects to this new item page.
- Show the transportation history and log (Ordered -> Pick-Up -> QA/QC -> Ready to Ship -> Out for Delivery -> Delivered) on this new item page.
