# Listing Detail Photo Carousel Fix

## Problem
- Listing detail page was not allowing users to scroll between different photos
- Page was using a static image display with thumbnails instead of the functional ImageCarousel component
- Users could not navigate through multiple photos of a listing

## Changes Made

### 1. Added ImageCarousel Import
- **File**: `app/(dashboard)/list-item/[id]/page.tsx`
- **Change**: Added import for ImageCarousel component
- **Reason**: Needed to use the carousel functionality

### 2. Replaced Static Image Display
- **File**: `app/(dashboard)/list-item/[id]/page.tsx`
- **Change**: Replaced static image and thumbnail system with ImageCarousel component
- **Features Added**:
  - Left/right arrow navigation
  - Dot indicators for multiple images
  - Smooth transitions between photos
  - Fixed button positioning (from previous fix)

### 3. Removed Unused State
- **File**: `app/(dashboard)/list-item/[id]/page.tsx`
- **Change**: Removed `selectedImage` state variable
- **Reason**: No longer needed since ImageCarousel handles its own state

### 4. Used Comprehensive Image Array
- **File**: `app/(dashboard)/list-item/[id]/page.tsx`
- **Change**: Used `listing.all_images` instead of `listing.image_urls_staged`
- **Benefit**: Shows all available photos (hero, back, proof, additional) in the carousel

## Configuration
- **showArrows**: true - Enables left/right navigation arrows
- **showDots**: true - Shows dot indicators for multiple images
- **autoPlay**: false - Prevents automatic sliding
- **className**: "w-full h-96 rounded-lg" - Maintains consistent styling

## Testing Instructions
1. Navigate to a listing detail page
2. Verify that left/right arrow buttons appear when hovering over the image
3. Test clicking the arrows to navigate between photos
4. Verify that dot indicators appear at the bottom for multiple images
5. Test clicking dots to jump to specific images
6. Ensure the carousel works with listings that have multiple photos

## Dependencies
- Uses existing ImageCarousel component (previously fixed for button positioning)
- No new dependencies required
