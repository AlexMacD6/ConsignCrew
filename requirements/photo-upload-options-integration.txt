# Photo Upload Options Integration

## Overview
Add options for users to choose between single photo upload (current system) and bulk photo upload on the list-item page, integrated with the video upload section.

## Current System
- Users upload photos one by one in sequence: Hero → Back → Proof → Additional
- Each photo type has specific requirements and validation
- Photos are processed individually through the existing upload flow

## New Requirements

### 1. Upload Method Selection
- Add a selection interface in step 2 (Photo Requirements) to choose upload method
- Two options:
  - **Single Photo Upload**: Current system (photo by photo)
  - **Bulk Photo Upload**: Upload multiple photos at once

### 2. Single Photo Upload (Enhanced)
- Keep existing functionality
- Improve UI to show it's the "step-by-step" approach
- Maintain current validation and requirements

### 3. Bulk Photo Upload (New)
- Allow users to select multiple photos at once
- Provide drag-and-drop interface
- Show preview of all selected photos
- Auto-categorize photos based on user selection or AI analysis
- Maintain same photo requirements (Hero, Back, Proof, Additional)

### 4. Integration Points
- Place upload method selection at the top of step 2
- Integrate with existing video upload workflow
- Maintain current photo validation logic
- Ensure both methods lead to the same form generation step

### 5. UI/UX Requirements
- Clear visual distinction between upload methods
- Intuitive interface for method selection
- Consistent styling with existing design
- Responsive design for mobile and desktop

### 6. Technical Requirements
- Add new state variables for upload method selection
- Implement bulk upload handler
- Maintain existing photo upload API integration
- Ensure backward compatibility with current system

## Implementation Details

### State Variables to Add
- `uploadMethod`: "single" | "bulk"
- `bulkPhotos`: Array of selected photos for bulk upload
- `bulkUploading`: Loading state for bulk upload

### New Functions to Implement
- `handleBulkPhotoSelection`: Handle multiple photo selection
- `handleBulkPhotoUpload`: Process bulk photo upload
- `autoCategorizePhotos`: Automatically assign photos to required types
- `validateBulkPhotos`: Ensure bulk photos meet requirements

### UI Components to Add
- Upload method selection radio buttons/cards
- Bulk photo selection interface
- Drag-and-drop area for bulk upload
- Photo preview grid for bulk selection
- Auto-categorization interface

## Success Criteria
- Users can seamlessly switch between upload methods
- Bulk upload maintains same photo quality and validation
- Both methods integrate with existing video upload workflow
- UI remains intuitive and responsive
- No regression in existing functionality
