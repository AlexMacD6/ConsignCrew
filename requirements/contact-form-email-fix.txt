# Contact Form Email Fix Requirements

## Original Issue
- Contact form was not sending emails despite showing success message
- Need to integrate AWS SES for email functionality

## Completed Tasks ✅

### AWS SES Integration
- ✅ Integrated AWS SES using Next.js Server Actions
- ✅ Created `app/lib/ses-server.ts` with dynamic imports to avoid bundling issues
- ✅ Created `app/lib/contact-actions.ts` for server-side form processing
- ✅ Implemented proper error handling for SES-specific errors
- ✅ Added user confirmation emails (with graceful fallback for unverified emails)
- ✅ Added support notification emails

### Email Functionality
- ✅ Support team receives detailed contact form submissions
- ✅ Users receive confirmation emails (when email is verified in SES)
- ✅ Graceful handling of SES verification issues
- ✅ Beautiful branded email templates with TreasureHub logo
- ✅ Simplified HTML to reduce spam filter triggers
- ✅ Brand-consistent design using Poppins font and TreasureHub color scheme
- ✅ Clean, professional layout with improved readability
- ✅ Fixed duplicate logo issue in email templates
- ✅ Comprehensive error handling and logging

### Rate Limiting & Security
- ✅ Implemented IP-based rate limiting (3 attempts per hour per IP)
- ✅ Added client IP detection from various headers (x-forwarded-for, x-real-ip, cf-connecting-ip)
- ✅ Rate limit tracking with automatic cleanup of expired records
- ✅ User-friendly error messages when rate limited
- ✅ IP address logging for security monitoring

### Database Integration
- ✅ Created Contact model in Prisma schema
- ✅ Added database migration for Contact table
- ✅ Contact form submissions saved to database with IP tracking
- ✅ Database record ID included in support notification emails
- ✅ Proper indexing on email and createdAt fields

### Technical Implementation
- ✅ Used Next.js Server Actions (`'use server'`) to avoid client-side bundling issues
- ✅ Dynamic imports for AWS SDK to prevent SSO dependency issues
- ✅ Zod validation for form data
- ✅ Proper TypeScript types and interfaces
- ✅ Comprehensive error handling and user feedback

## Current Status
