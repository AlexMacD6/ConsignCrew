# AI Image Carousel Positioning and Similarity Check

## Overview
Move AI-generated staged photos to second position in image carousel, add "Staged scene - for inspiration" labels, and implement cosine similarity scoring between AI and hero images with admin-only visibility.

## Requirements

### 1. Image Carousel Reordering
- **Current Order**: AI image (proof) → Hero → Back → Additional
- **New Order**: Hero → AI image (proof) → Back → Additional
- **Rationale**: Hero image should be first as it's the main product photo
- **AI Image Position**: Second position with clear labeling

### 2. AI Image Labeling
- **Label Text**: "Staged scene - for inspiration"
- **Visibility**: Always visible on AI-generated images
- **Styling**: Subtle overlay badge that doesn't obstruct the image
- **Purpose**: Clear identification that image is AI-generated for inspiration

### 3. Cosine Similarity Implementation
- **Comparison**: Between AI-generated image and hero image
- **Method**: Cosine similarity algorithm for image comparison
- **Storage**: Store similarity score in database or calculate on-demand
- **Performance**: Efficient implementation that doesn't slow page load

### 4. Admin-Only Similarity Score Display
- **Visibility**: Only admins can see similarity scores
- **Location**: On listing detail pages
- **Format**: Percentage or decimal score with clear context
- **Purpose**: Quality control and AI performance monitoring

### 5. Technical Requirements
- Update image array ordering in listing transformation
- Add image labeling capability to ImageCarousel component
- Implement cosine similarity calculation function
- Add admin check for score visibility
- Ensure performance doesn't impact user experience

### 6. Implementation Details
- **Image Ordering**: Modify `all_images` array construction
- **Label Integration**: Enhance ImageCarousel to support image labels
- **Similarity API**: Create endpoint or function for similarity calculation
- **Admin Check**: Use existing admin status detection
- **Database**: Consider storing similarity scores for performance

## Benefits
- Better user experience with hero image first
- Clear identification of AI-generated content
- Quality control tool for AI performance
- Admin insights into AI accuracy
- Maintains trust through transparency about AI content
