AI Service Cost Control Implementation

**Objective:**
Ensure that the AI service only uses GPT-5 when explicitly selected in the admin dashboard, preventing unnecessary costs from using expensive models when not needed.

**Problem Identified:**
- AI service was potentially using GPT-5 even when not configured in admin dashboard
- No clear cost transparency for administrators
- Risk of unexpected billing from using expensive AI models

**Solution Implemented:**

1. **Enhanced Cost Control in AI Service:**
   - Added validation to ensure model selection matches admin dashboard configuration
   - Added comprehensive cost logging throughout the AI generation process
   - Clear distinction between GPT-4o (standard cost) and GPT-5 (higher cost) usage

2. **Cost Transparency Logging:**
   - Added "ðŸ’° COST CONTROL" logging section showing which model will be used
   - Added "ðŸ’° COST SUMMARY" at the end showing what was actually used
   - Clear indication of cost tier (HIGH vs STANDARD)
   - API method transparency (Responses API vs Chat Completions API)

3. **Admin Dashboard Cost Information:**
   - Added cost control information box with warning icon
   - Clear cost implications for each model option
   - Helpful tips for cost optimization
   - Updated option descriptions to include cost information

4. **Validation and Safety Checks:**
   - Added warning if admin dashboard shows GPT-5 but different model is used
   - Ensures model selection is respected throughout the process
   - Prevents accidental use of expensive models

**Files Modified:**
- app/api/ai/generate-comprehensive-listing/route.ts
- app/admin/page.tsx

**Key Features:**

**Cost Control Logging:**
- Shows which model is configured in admin dashboard
- Indicates cost tier (HIGH vs STANDARD)
- Shows API method being used
- Logs cost savings when using GPT-4o

**Admin Dashboard Enhancements:**
- Cost information warning box
- Clear cost implications for each model
- Optimization tips for administrators
- Updated option descriptions with cost details

**Safety Measures:**
- Validation that model selection is respected
- Warning if configuration mismatch detected
- Clear logging of what was actually used vs. requested

**Result:**
- Administrators have full control over AI model costs
- Clear transparency into what models are being used
- Prevention of accidental expensive model usage
- Cost optimization guidance for administrators

**Testing:**
- Verify GPT-4o is used when configured in admin dashboard
- Verify GPT-5 is only used when explicitly selected
- Check cost control logging appears correctly
- Verify admin dashboard cost information is displayed

**Cost Implications:**
- GPT-4o: Standard cost, excellent visual analysis
- GPT-5: Higher cost, advanced reasoning capabilities
- Recommendation: Start with GPT-4o, upgrade to GPT-5 only when needed
