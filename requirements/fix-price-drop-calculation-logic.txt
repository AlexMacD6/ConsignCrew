Fix Price Drop Calculation Logic

**Problem Identified:**
The price drop calculation was incorrectly based on retail price instead of the original list price, causing confusion in the UI.

**Root Cause:**
- Price drops were calculated as percentages of retail price (e.g., $200 retail × 80% = $160)
- This made it appear that prices would "drop" to amounts higher than the current list price
- User saw "Price will drop to $180" when current price was $120, which was confusing

**Solution Implemented:**
1. **Updated PriceDropCounter Component:**
   - Changed calculation logic to use ORIGINAL LIST PRICE instead of retail price
   - Updated comments to clarify "percentage of list price" not "percentage of retail price"
   - Maintained the same discount schedule percentages but applied them to list price

2. **Updated Discount Schedule Logic:**
   - Modified `calculateNextDropPriceFromOriginal` function comments
   - Clarified that percentages are based on original list price
   - Updated example calculations to show list price-based drops

3. **Updated API Endpoint:**
   - Clarified comments in `/api/listings/[id]/next-price-drop/route.ts`
   - Maintained existing logic which was already correct

**Corrected Logic Example:**
- Original List Price: $120
- Classic-60 Schedule: 100% → 90% → 80% → 75% of LIST PRICE
- Day 7: 90% of $120 = $108 (first drop)
- Day 14: 80% of $120 = $96 (second drop) 
- Day 21: 75% of $120 = $90 (third drop)

**UI Improvements:**
- Shows "Price will drop to $96 (from $120)" when price actually decreases
- Shows "Next scheduled price: $96 (current: $120)" for context
- Uses red color for actual drops, blue for scheduled prices
- Always shows current price for context

**Files Modified:**
- app/components/PriceDropCounter.tsx
- app/lib/discount-schedule.ts  
- app/api/listings/[id]/next-price-drop/route.ts

**Testing:**
- Verified corrected logic with test script
- Confirmed price drops now work as expected: $120 → $108 → $96 → $90
- UI now clearly shows when prices will actually drop vs. scheduled prices

**Result:**
Price drops now work correctly based on the original list price, providing clear and predictable pricing for users.
