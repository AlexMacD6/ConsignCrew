# Development Server Preference

## User Preference
- Do NOT automatically start `npm run dev` when a development server is already running
- User finds it annoying when multiple dev servers are started
- Only start dev server if explicitly requested or if no server is currently running

## Guidelines
- Check if dev server is already running before starting a new one
- Ask user if they want to restart the dev server if needed
- Only auto-start dev server for initial setup or when explicitly needed
- Respect user's current development workflow

## Implementation
- Before running `npm run dev`, check if port 3000 is already in use
- If dev server is running, inform user and ask if restart is needed
- Only proceed with dev server start if explicitly requested
