# Photo 3 (Proof) Required Update

## Overview
Update the photo requirements to make Photo 3 (Proof) required instead of optional, and fix text alignment issues in the photo progress section.

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements
- Change Photo 3 (Proof) from "Optional" to "Required"
- Update photo requirements notice to reflect Photo 3 as mandatory
- Fix text alignment in photo progress section
- Ensure consistent styling across all photo indicators

### UI/UX Requirements
- Photo 3 should show "Required" in red text like Photos 1 and 2
- All photo indicators should have consistent text alignment
- Additional photos section should maintain "Optional" status
- Photo requirements notice should accurately reflect new requirements

### Technical Requirements
- Update photo progress indicators styling
- Fix additional photos "+" button to match numbered circles
- Update photo requirements notice text
- Maintain existing validation logic (already includes proof photo)

## Implementation Details

### Changes Made
1. **Photo 3 Indicator**
   - Changed text from "Optional" to "Required"
   - Updated styling to match Photos 1 and 2 (red text, font-medium)

2. **Additional Photos Indicator**
   - Fixed "+" button to use same circular styling as numbered indicators
   - Ensured consistent text alignment across all photo sections

3. **Photo Requirements Notice**
   - Updated text to include Photo 3 as required
   - Changed from "Photos #1 (Front) and #2 (Back)" to "Photos #1 (Front), #2 (Back), and #3 (Proof)"
   - Updated optional section to only mention additional photos

### Validation Logic
- `hasMinimumPhotos()` function already includes proof photo requirement
- `isFormValid` already includes proof photo requirement
- No changes needed to validation logic

## User Experience Impact
- Users now understand that Photo 3 (Proof) is mandatory
- Consistent visual alignment across all photo indicators
- Clear distinction between required and optional photos
- Form validation already enforces Photo 3 requirement

## Testing
- Verify Photo 3 shows "Required" in red text
- Confirm all photo indicators are properly aligned
- Test form validation with and without Photo 3
- Verify photo requirements notice is accurate
- Check responsive behavior on different screen sizes
