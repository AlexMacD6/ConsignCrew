# Meta Pixel Production Optimization Requirements

## Overview
Optimize the Meta Pixel integration for production use with Facebook's best practices for event deduplication, performance, and data quality.

## Key Improvements Implemented

### 1. Event Deduplication with event_id
- **Problem**: When sending the same event via Browser and CAPI, Facebook counts each event twice without deduplication
- **Solution**: Generate unique event_id using UUID v4 for each event
- **Implementation**: 
  - Added `uuid` package dependency
  - Modified `trackMetaPixelEvent` to generate and pass event_id
  - Updated server-side API to handle event_id parameter

### 2. Optimized Fallback Logic
- **Problem**: Double-sending every event even when browser tracking succeeds
- **Solution**: Only call server-side API if browser tracking fails or is unavailable
- **Implementation**:
  - Added `browserSent` flag to track browser success
  - Skip server call when browser tracking succeeds
  - Improved error handling and logging

### 3. Enhanced Data Quality
- **Problem**: Missing required fields and incomplete event data
- **Solution**: Add action_source and improve data completeness
- **Implementation**:
  - Added `action_source: 'website'` to all server-side events
  - Enhanced ViewContent tracking with additional Facebook Shop fields
  - Improved type safety with stricter interfaces

### 4. Stricter TypeScript Types
- **Problem**: Optional fields causing type issues and runtime errors
- **Solution**: Create proper interfaces with required vs optional fields
- **Implementation**:
  - Created `ProductEvent` interface with required `content_ids`
  - Created `CartItem` interface for purchase events
  - Made `search_string` required for Search events
  - Made `value` required for Purchase events

### 5. Removed Duplicate Initialization
- **Problem**: `initMetaPixel()` function could create duplicate pixel instances
- **Solution**: Remove redundant initialization function
- **Implementation**:
  - Removed `initMetaPixel()` function
  - Kept only the automatic initialization in `MetaPixelScript.tsx`

### 6. Enhanced Cart/Purchase Events
- **Problem**: Missing Facebook's preferred `contents` array format
- **Solution**: Add support for contents array with item details
- **Implementation**:
  - Added `createContentsArray()` helper function
  - Updated `trackPurchase()` to support contents array
  - Enhanced purchase event data structure

### 7. Environment Variable Guards
- **Problem**: Missing pixel ID causing console errors
- **Solution**: Add proper guards against missing environment variables
- **Implementation**:
  - Added pixel ID validation in `MetaPixelScript.tsx`
  - Skip browser tracking if pixel ID is missing
  - Improved error logging and warnings

## Files Modified

### Core Files
- `app/lib/meta-pixel-client.ts` - Main tracking functions with deduplication
- `app/components/MetaPixelScript.tsx` - Script initialization with guards
- `app/api/meta/conversion/route.ts` - Server-side API with event_id support
- `app/(dashboard)/list-item/[id]/page.tsx` - ViewContent tracking with new types

### Dependencies Added
- `uuid` - For generating unique event IDs
- `@types/uuid` - TypeScript definitions

## Testing Requirements

### 1. Event Deduplication Testing
- Verify ViewContent events have unique event_id
- Check Facebook Events Manager for duplicate events
- Test both browser and server-side tracking paths

### 2. Fallback Logic Testing
- Test with ad blockers enabled
- Test with JavaScript disabled
- Verify server-side fallback only triggers when needed

### 3. Data Quality Testing
- Verify all required fields are present in events
- Check Facebook Events Manager for event completeness scores
- Test with various product data scenarios

### 4. Type Safety Testing
- Verify TypeScript compilation without errors
- Test with missing required fields (should show errors)
- Validate interface compliance

## Production Checklist

- [ ] All events include unique event_id
- [ ] Server-side calls only happen when browser fails
- [ ] action_source is set to 'website' for all events
- [ ] Required fields are properly validated
- [ ] Environment variables are properly guarded
- [ ] No duplicate pixel initialization
- [ ] Enhanced logging for debugging
- [ ] TypeScript types are strict and accurate

## Performance Impact

### Positive Impacts
- Reduced server load (fewer redundant API calls)
- Better event deduplication (improved Facebook match quality)
- Enhanced data completeness (better conversion tracking)

### Monitoring Points
- Event delivery success rates
- Facebook Events Manager event counts
- Server-side API call frequency
- Browser vs server-side tracking ratios

## Future Enhancements

### 1. User Data Hashing
- Implement SHA-256 hashing for email and phone
- Add hashed user_data to server-side events
- Improve Facebook match quality

### 2. Advanced Deduplication
- Implement event deduplication window
- Add event timestamp validation
- Handle edge cases with multiple tabs/windows

### 3. Enhanced Error Handling
- Add retry logic for failed events
- Implement event queuing for offline scenarios
- Add comprehensive error reporting

### 4. Performance Monitoring
- Add event tracking performance metrics
- Monitor event delivery latency
- Track browser vs server-side success rates
