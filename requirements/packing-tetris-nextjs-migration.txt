# Packing Tetris Next.js Migration

## Issue
- Packing Tetris landing page was using Vite and needed to be migrated to Next.js
- All 3D components and functionality needed to be preserved
- TypeScript conversion required for better type safety

## Solution
- Migrated all components from JSX to TypeScript
- Recreated the 3D interactive experience in Next.js
- Added proper API routes for email subscription
- Maintained all original functionality and animations

## Changes Made

### Components Migrated
- **Scene.tsx**: Main 3D scene with camera animations and lighting
- **Crate.tsx**: 3D crate with physics walls and visual styling
- **BoxSpawner.tsx**: Dynamic box spawning with physics and animations
- **SignupModal.tsx**: Email signup modal with animations and form handling
- **useCrateFull.ts**: Custom hook for detecting when crate is full

### New Files Created
- **app/packing-tetris/page.tsx**: Main page component for the 3D experience
- **app/api/subscribe/route.ts**: API endpoint for email subscriptions
- **app/components/**: All 3D components converted to TypeScript
- **app/hooks/**: Custom hooks converted to TypeScript

### Styles Added
- Added Packing Tetris specific styles to globals.css
- Modal backdrop with blur effect
- Canvas touch-action handling
- Reduced motion support
- Custom scrollbar styling
- ConsignCrew brand colors

### TypeScript Features
- Proper interfaces for all component props
- Type-safe event handlers
- Strict type checking for all functions
- Proper typing for React Three Fiber components

## Functionality Preserved

### 3D Experience
- ✅ Box spawning with random sizes and colors
- ✅ Physics simulation with gravity and collisions
- ✅ Crate full detection (height or count-based)
- ✅ Camera animation into the crate
- ✅ Box fading effects
- ✅ Realistic wooden crate appearance

### User Experience
- ✅ Skip animation button
- ✅ Reduced motion support
- ✅ Email signup modal
- ✅ Success states and animations
- ✅ Local storage for signup status
- ✅ Responsive design

### Accessibility
- ✅ Keyboard navigation
- ✅ Screen reader support
- ✅ Reduced motion detection
- ✅ Proper ARIA labels
- ✅ Focus management

## API Integration
- **POST /api/subscribe**: Handles email subscriptions
- Mock implementation ready for real email service integration
- Proper error handling and validation
- TypeScript types for request/response

## Testing
- All components should render without errors
- 3D scene should load and animate properly
- Physics simulation should work correctly
- Email signup should function
- Accessibility features should work

## Next Steps
- Integrate with real email service (Mailchimp, SendGrid, etc.)
- Add analytics tracking
- Optimize 3D performance for mobile
- Add sound effects (optional)
- Implement A/B testing for conversion optimization
