# Simplify Notes: Display Only in Table, Edit via Modal

## Issue

Notes weren't being saved when edited inline in the table. The complexity of having two editing interfaces (table inline editing + modal editing) was causing confusion and not working properly.

## Solution

Simplified the notes UI to have a single source of truth:
- **Table**: Display notes only (read-only)
- **Modal**: Edit notes when receiving/trashing/using items

## Changes Made

### 1. Removed Inline Note Editing State

**Deleted:**
```typescript
// Notes editing state
const [editingNoteId, setEditingNoteId] = useState<string | null>(null);
const [editingNoteText, setEditingNoteText] = useState("");
```

### 2. Removed Note Editing Functions

**Deleted:**
```typescript
const startEditingNote = (row: DisplayRow) => { /* ... */ };
const cancelEditingNote = () => { /* ... */ };
const saveNote = async (row: DisplayRow) => { /* ... */ };
```

These functions were handling inline table editing, which we no longer need.

### 3. Simplified Notes Column in Table

**Before (Complex - Editable):**
```tsx
<td className="py-3 px-4">
  {row.type === "MANIFESTED" ? (
    <div>Receive first to add notes</div>
  ) : editingNoteId === `${row.itemId}-${row.type}` ? (
    // Edit mode with input, save, cancel buttons
    <div className="flex items-center gap-2">
      <input ... />
      <button onClick={() => saveNote(row)}>Save</button>
      <button onClick={cancelEditingNote}>Cancel</button>
    </div>
  ) : (
    // View mode - clickable to edit
    <div onClick={() => startEditingNote(row)}>
      {row.notes || "Click to add note"}
    </div>
  )}
</td>
```

**After (Simple - Display Only):**
```tsx
<td className="py-3 px-4">
  <div className="text-xs text-gray-600 max-w-xs">
    {row.type === "MANIFESTED" ? (
      <span className="text-gray-400 italic">
        Use modal to add notes
      </span>
    ) : (
      row.notes || (
        <span className="text-gray-400 italic">
          Use modal to add notes
        </span>
      )
    )}
  </div>
</td>
```

## How It Works Now

### Adding/Editing Notes

**Only way to edit notes: Through the modal**

1. Click **Receive**, **Trash**, or **Use** button
2. Modal opens with quantity and notes fields
3. Enter/edit notes in the **Notes (optional)** textarea
4. Click the action button (e.g., "Receive")
5. Notes are saved along with the disposition

### Viewing Notes

**Table displays current notes (read-only)**

- If a disposition has notes: Shows the note text
- If no notes: Shows "Use modal to add notes" (gray italic)
- For MANIFESTED items: Shows "Use modal to add notes" (can't add notes until allocated)

## User Flow Examples

### Example 1: Add Note When Receiving Items
```
1. Item has 2 manifested units
2. Click "Receive" button
3. Modal opens:
   - Quantity: 2
   - Notes: [empty textarea]
4. Type note: "Both items in excellent condition"
5. Click "Receive"
6. Table now shows: "Both items in excellent condition"
```

### Example 2: Update Note When Changing Status
```
1. Item has 2 RECEIVED units with note: "Good condition"
2. Click "Trash" button
3. Modal opens:
   - Quantity: 2
   - Notes: [empty - TRASH doesn't have notes yet]
4. Type note: "Both damaged during inspection"
5. Set quantity to 2
6. Click "Trash"
7. Table now shows: "Both damaged during inspection"
```

### Example 3: View Existing Notes
```
1. Look at table
2. Notes column shows current note for each disposition
3. To change: Click the action button → Edit in modal
```

## Benefits

### Before (Complex):
- ❌ Two ways to edit notes (table + modal)
- ❌ Confusing which one to use
- ❌ Inline editing wasn't saving properly
- ❌ More state management complexity
- ❌ Had to handle click events, focus, save/cancel

### After (Simple):
- ✅ One way to edit notes (modal only)
- ✅ Clear workflow: Use action buttons → Edit in modal
- ✅ Notes save reliably with disposition changes
- ✅ Simpler state management
- ✅ Cleaner UI - table is just for viewing

## Modal Notes Field

The modal already has a notes field:

```tsx
{/* Notes Input (Optional) */}
<div>
  <label className="block text-sm font-medium text-gray-700 mb-2">
    Notes (optional)
  </label>
  <textarea
    value={modalNotes}
    onChange={(e) => setModalNotes(e.target.value)}
    className="w-full px-4 py-2 border rounded-lg focus:outline-none focus:ring-2 focus:ring-[#D4AF3D]"
    rows={3}
    placeholder="Add any notes about this action..."
  />
</div>
```

When you receive/trash/use items, the notes are sent to the API:

```typescript
body: JSON.stringify({
  status: modal.type,
  quantity: modalQuantity,
  notes: modalNotes || undefined,  // ← Notes included
}),
```

## Testing

1. Navigate to Inventory Receiving
2. Find an item with notes
3. Verify notes are displayed in the table (read-only)
4. Click action button (Receive/Trash/Use)
5. Verify modal opens with notes textarea
6. Add/edit notes in the modal
7. Submit the modal
8. Verify notes appear in the table after page refreshes
9. Verify you can't click notes in the table to edit them

## UI Consistency

The notes column now matches the rest of the table:
- Simple display cells
- No interactive elements in the table
- All actions happen through the dedicated action buttons
- Modal is the single interface for all changes
