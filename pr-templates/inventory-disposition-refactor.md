# Inventory Disposition System Refactor

## Changelog

### Database Schema Changes
- **Removed fields from `InventoryItem` model**:
  - `receiveStatus` (enum field)
  - `receivedQuantity`, `receivedAt`, `receivedBy`
  - `disposition`, `dispositionQuantity`, `dispositionAt`, `dispositionBy`, `dispositionNotes`
  
- **Created new `InventoryDisposition` model**:
  - Tracks individual disposition records for inventory items
  - Allows splitting items into multiple statuses (e.g., 1 RECEIVED, 1 TRASH, 1 USE)
  - Fields: `id`, `inventoryItemId`, `status`, `quantity`, `notes`, `createdAt`, `updatedAt`, `createdBy`
  
- **Created new `InventoryItemStatus` enum**:
  - `RECEIVED` - Normal received items (for resale)
  - `TRASH` - Items disposed of (damaged, unsellable)
  - `USE` - Items kept for personal/business use (use tax applicable)

### API Changes

#### `app/api/admin/inventory/items/[id]/disposition/route.ts`
- **Complete rewrite** to support new disposition model
- `GET` - Fetch all dispositions for an item
- `POST` - Create or add to a disposition status
- `PUT` - Update total quantity for a specific status (replaces old quantity)
- All endpoints now work with the new `InventoryDisposition` model

#### `app/api/admin/inventory/items/route.ts`
- Updated to include `dispositions` relation
- Calculate disposition quantities (`receivedQuantity`, `trashedQuantity`, `usedQuantity`, `manifestedQuantity`) from disposition records
- Removed database-level filtering for `receiveStatus` (now calculated on-the-fly)
- Added post-fetch filtering for status and inStock parameters

### Frontend Changes

#### `app/admin/InventoryReceiving.tsx`
- Updated `Item` interface to reflect new API structure
- Removed `receiveStatus`, `disposition`, `dispositionQuantity` fields
- Added `totalQuantity`, `receivedQuantity`, `trashedQuantity`, `usedQuantity`, `manifestedQuantity` fields
- Added `dispositions` array field

- **Refactored `getDisplayRows` function**:
  - Now creates rows from `dispositions` array instead of calculating from old fields
  - Supports multiple disposition rows per item

- **Updated `openModal` function**:
  - Uses new quantity fields (`manifestedQuantity`, `receivedQuantity`, etc.)
  - For RECEIVED: max quantity = manifested items
  - For TRASH/USE: max quantity = total items (can reallocate from any status)

- **Simplified `handleModalSubmit` function**:
  - Removed `/receive` endpoint calls
  - All status changes now use `/disposition` PUT endpoint
  - Unified approach for RECEIVED, TRASH, and USE

- **Enhanced modal UI**:
  - Shows current breakdown of all statuses
  - Clearer messaging about what the action will do
  - Displays manifested, received, trashed, and used quantities

### Key Benefits

1. **Flexibility**: Items can now be split into multiple statuses (e.g., 1 received for resale, 1 trashed)
2. **Unified Logic**: Single disposition endpoint handles all status changes
3. **Better Tracking**: Full history of disposition records stored separately
4. **Simpler Mental Model**: Three clear statuses (RECEIVED, TRASH, USE) instead of complex disposition + receiveStatus combination

4. Start the application with `npm run dev`

### Test Scenarios

#### Scenario 1: Receive Items from Manifest
1. Navigate to Admin â†’ Inventory Receiving
2. Find an item with "Manifested" quantity > 0
3. Click "Receive" button
4. Enter quantity to receive (up to manifested amount)
5. Submit
6. **Expected**: Item shows in "Received" row with green badge

#### Scenario 2: Mark Items as Trash
1. Find an item with received quantity
2. Click "Trash" button
3. Enter quantity to mark as trash
4. Add notes (e.g., "Damaged in shipping")
5. Submit
6. **Expected**: Item shows in "Trash" row with red badge and trash icon

#### Scenario 3: Split Item Between Statuses
1. Find an item with 2+ total quantity, currently all received
2. Click "Trash" and set quantity to 1
3. Submit
4. **Expected**: Two rows appear:
   - Row 1: 1 RECEIVED (green)
   - Row 2: 1 TRASH (red, with notes)

#### Scenario 4: Change Status
1. Find an item currently marked as TRASH
2. Click "Use" button
3. Set quantity to same amount as currently trashed
4. Submit
5. **Expected**: Status changes from TRASH to USE

#### Scenario 5: Multiple Status Allocations
1. Find an item with 3 total quantity, all manifested
2. Receive 1 item
3. Click "Trash" and set to 1
4. Click "Use" and set to 1
5. **Expected**: Three rows:
   - Row 1: 1 RECEIVED
   - Row 2: 1 TRASH
   - Row 3: 1 USE
   - Manifested column shows: 0

### Verify Data Integrity
- Total of all status quantities should equal total manifest quantity
- Manifested quantity should be: Total - (Received + Trashed + Used)
- No negative quantities
- Status badges show correct colors and icons
