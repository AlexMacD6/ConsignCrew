# Stripe Webhook Reliability Improvements

## Changelog

- Enhanced webhook debugging capabilities
  - Added `/api/test/webhook-debug` endpoint for debugging webhook issues
  - Can check Stripe session status, order status, and webhook configuration
  - Can manually simulate webhook processing for stuck orders
- Improved webhook error handling
  - Added better logging for webhook events
  - Enhanced error tracking for failed webhook processing
- Added manual order completion endpoint
  - Existing `/api/test/complete-order` endpoint can complete stuck orders
  - Takes session ID parameter to identify and complete orders

## Solutions for "Processing" Order Issues

### 1. Webhook Environment Setup
Ensure Stripe CLI is properly configured:
```bash
stripe listen --forward-to localhost:3000/api/webhooks/stripe
```

### 2. Manual Order Completion
If an order is stuck in "Processing" status, use the manual completion endpoint:
```
GET /api/test/complete-order?sessionId=cs_test_...
```

### 3. Webhook Debugging
Debug webhook issues using:
```
GET /api/test/webhook-debug?sessionId=cs_test_...
```

### 4. Environment Variables Required
Ensure these are set in your `.env.local`:
- `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY`
- `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET`

## Testing Instructions

1. Pull this branch and start the application
2. Make a test purchase and note the checkout session ID
3. If the order shows "Processing" after payment:
   - Use the debug endpoint: `/api/test/webhook-debug?sessionId=YOUR_SESSION_ID`
   - Check if webhook is configured properly
   - If webhook failed, manually complete: `/api/test/complete-order?sessionId=YOUR_SESSION_ID`
4. Verify that manual completion updates order status to "PAID" and listing status to "sold"
5. Test with Stripe CLI webhook forwarding to ensure webhooks fire consistently
