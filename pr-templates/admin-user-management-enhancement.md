## Security Considerations

- ‚úÖ **Admin-only access** - All operations require ADMIN or OWNER role
- ‚úÖ **Input validation** - Role and organization parameters are validated
- ‚úÖ **Permission checks** - API endpoints verify user permissions before operations
- ‚úÖ **Data validation** - Ensures organizations and users exist before operations

---

## Breaking Changes

**None** - All changes are backward compatible and enhance existing functionality.

---

## Dependencies

- Next.js (existing)
- Prisma (existing)
- BetterAuth (existing)
- No new packages required

## Notes for Reviewers

- The enhanced user management maintains the existing design language and color scheme
- All new functionality follows the established patterns in the admin dashboard
- API endpoints include comprehensive error handling and validation
- The UI is responsive and follows accessibility best practices
- Role management is organization-specific, allowing users to have different roles in different organizations
