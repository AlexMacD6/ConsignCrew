## Testing Instructions

1. **Price Drop Counter Testing**:
   - Navigate to a listing with price drop schedule configured
   - Verify the countdown displays smoothly without blinking between "Next Price Drop" and "Loading"
   - Check that the countdown updates every second without flickering
   - Verify that when countdown reaches zero, it refreshes data silently without showing loading state

2. **Edit Listing Page Testing**:
   - Navigate to edit listing page for an existing listing (e.g., `/list-item/EJCONC/edit`)
   - Verify department dropdown shows the correct department from the listing
   - Verify category dropdown shows the correct category (not "Select Category")
   - Verify sub-category dropdown shows the correct sub-category (if applicable)
   - Verify discount schedule field is visible and populated with the correct value
   - Test editing and saving changes to ensure all fields work properly

3. **Form Validation Testing**:
   - Ensure all form fields maintain proper state management
   - Verify no controlled/uncontrolled input warnings in console
   - Test that changes are saved correctly when submitting the form

4. **Cross-browser Testing**:
   - Test in Chrome, Firefox, and Safari to ensure consistent behavior
   - Verify countdown timer works correctly across different browsers
