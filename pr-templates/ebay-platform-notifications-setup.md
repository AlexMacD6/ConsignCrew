## Testing Instructions

1. **Database Migration**
   - Pull this branch and run `npx prisma migrate dev --name add_ebay_notifications`
   - Verify that `EbayNotification`, `EbayItem`, and `EbayNotificationLog` tables are created

2. **Environment Setup**
   - Add eBay environment variables to `.env`:
     ```
     EBAY_APP_ID=your_ebay_app_id_here
     EBAY_CERT_ID=your_ebay_certificate_id_here
     EBAY_CLIENT_SECRET=your_ebay_client_secret_here
     EBAY_NOTIFICATION_ENDPOINT_URL=https://treasurehub.club/api/ebay/notifications
     EBAY_SANDBOX_MODE=true
     ```

3. **Webhook Endpoint Testing**
   - Start the application with `npm run dev`
   - Test main notifications health check: `GET http://localhost:3000/api/ebay/notifications`
   - Should return: `{"status":"healthy","message":"eBay notifications endpoint is operational"}`
   - Test account deletion health check: `GET http://localhost:3000/api/ebay/marketplace-account-deletion`
   - Should return: `{"status":"healthy","message":"eBay marketplace account deletion endpoint is operational","endpoint":"marketplace-account-deletion"}`

4. **Admin Endpoint Testing**
   - Access `/api/admin/ebay/notifications` (requires admin authentication)
   - Test with query parameters: `?page=1&limit=20&topic=ITEM_UPDATED`
   - Should return paginated notification data and statistics

5. **eBay Integration Testing**
   - Set up eBay Developer account and application
   - Subscribe to notification topics using admin API
   - Monitor webhook delivery and processing
   - Check notification logs for any errors

6. **Database Verification**
   - Verify notifications are stored in `EbayNotification` table
   - Check that items are tracked in `EbayItem` table
   - Review audit logs in `EbayNotificationLog` table

## Notes

- **Signature Verification**: The webhook signature verification is currently a TODO. Implement proper verification using eBay's public key before production use.
- **Sandbox Mode**: Default configuration uses eBay sandbox for testing. Change `EBAY_SANDBOX_MODE=false` for production.
- **Security**: Consider implementing rate limiting and IP whitelisting for webhook endpoints.
- **Monitoring**: Use the admin dashboard to monitor notification processing and troubleshoot issues.
