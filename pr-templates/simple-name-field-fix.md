  - No complex field mapping logic required
  - Natural BetterAuth compatibility achieved

- Enhanced data flexibility
  - OAuth users have their full name stored in the `name` field

## Testing Instructions

1. Pull this branch and run `npm install`
2. The database migration should have already been applied
3. Start the application with `npm run dev`
4. Test OAuth registration:
   - Try registering with Google OAuth
   - Verify that the user is created successfully without errors
   - Check that the `name` field is populated in the database
5. Test email/password registration:
   - Try registering with email and password
   - Verify that firstName and lastName are used
   - Check that the `name` field is null in the database
6. Verify database schema:
   - Confirm that users are created with the correct fields
   - Verify that the `name` field is present and optional

## Data Examples

- **OAuth Registration**: `{ name: "John Doe", firstName: "", lastName: "", email: "..." }`
- **Email/Password**: `{ name: null, firstName: "John", lastName: "Doe", email: "..." }`
- **Mixed Data**: `{ name: "John Doe", firstName: "John", lastName: "Smith", email: "..." }`

## Technical Details

### Prisma Schema Change
```prisma
model user {
  id            String   @id @default(cuid())
  name          String?  // BetterAuth expects this field from OAuth providers
  firstName     String
  lastName      String
  // ... other fields
}
```

### BetterAuth Configuration
```typescript
additionalFields: {
  name: { type: "string", required: false }, // Allow BetterAuth to pass name field
  firstName: { type: "string", required: true },
  lastName: { type: "string", required: true },
  // ... other fields
}
```
