## Testing Instructions

1. Pull this branch and run `npm install`
2. Ensure your `.env` file has all required environment variables:
   - `BETTER_AUTH_SECRET`
   - `BETTER_AUTH_URL`
   - `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`
   - `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`
   - `AWS_SES_DEFAULT_FROM_EMAIL`
3. Start the development server with `npm run dev`
4. Navigate to `/register` and create a new account with a valid email address
5. Check the server console logs for:
   - `=== REGISTRATION START ===`
   - `registerUser - Manually sending verification email via SES...`
   - `registerUser - SES email sent successfully`
6. Check your email inbox for the verification email
7. Click the verification link in the email
8. Verify that the user's email is marked as verified in the database

## Expected Behavior

- User registration should complete successfully
- Verification email should be sent automatically (either via BetterAuth or manual fallback)
- Email should contain TreasureHub branding and proper verification link
- Clicking the verification link should mark the user's email as verified
- User should be able to access protected routes after verification

## Notes

- This fix implements a manual fallback for email verification when BetterAuth's automatic trigger doesn't work
- The verification URL format follows BetterAuth's expected pattern
- All email templates include proper TreasureHub branding and styling
- Comprehensive logging has been added for debugging purposes
