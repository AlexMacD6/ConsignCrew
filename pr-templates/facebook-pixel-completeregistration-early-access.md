# Facebook Pixel CompleteRegistration Tracking for Early Access Signup

## Changelog

### CompleteRegistration Event Implementation
- Added CompleteRegistration event tracking for early access email signups
  - **New Function**: Created `trackCompleteRegistration` in `meta-pixel-client.ts`
  - **Server-Side Tracking**: Added to subscribe API route (`/api/subscribe`)
  - **Client-Side Tracking**: Added to main page signup form and signup modal
  - **Comprehensive Data**: Includes signup source, number, and lead generation category
- Enhanced early access signup tracking
  - **Event Data**: content_name, content_category, value, currency, source, signup_number
  - **Lead Generation Category**: Properly categorized as "Lead Generation" for Facebook optimization
  - **Source Tracking**: Tracks whether signup came from hero, modal, or other sources
  - **Sequential Numbers**: Includes database signup number for better analytics

### Implementation Locations
- **Subscribe API Route** (`app/api/subscribe/route.ts`):
  - Server-side tracking for all successful new signups
  - Only tracks new signups, not existing email addresses
  - Includes comprehensive event data for Facebook optimization
- **Main Page** (`app/page.tsx`):
  - Client-side tracking in hero section email signup form
  - Tracks successful signups with source identification
  - Non-blocking implementation that doesn't affect user experience
- **Signup Modal** (`app/components/SignupModal.tsx`):
  - Client-side tracking for modal popup signups
  - Includes modal-specific source tracking
  - Graceful error handling without breaking signup flow

### Technical Implementation
- **CompleteRegistration Function**: New tracking function with lead generation focus
- **Dual Tracking**: Both server-side and client-side tracking for maximum coverage
- **Error Handling**: Non-blocking implementation that doesn't affect signup functionality
- **Fallback Support**: Uses server-side tracking if client-side fails
- **Performance**: Asynchronous tracking that doesn't impact signup experience

### Lead Generation Enhancements
- **Timing**: CompleteRegistration tracking occurs immediately after successful signup
- **Data Quality**: Includes all available signup information for optimal lead tracking
- **User Experience**: Signup functionality works normally even if tracking fails
- **Comprehensive Coverage**: Tracks signups from all entry points (hero, modal, etc.)
