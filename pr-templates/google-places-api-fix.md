## Testing Instructions

1. Pull this branch and run `npm install`
2. Start the application with `npm run dev`
3. Navigate to `/profile` and log in
4. Click the "Edit" button to enter edit mode
5. In the street address field, type an address (e.g., "1807 Greengrass")
6. Select an address from the Google Places API dropdown
7. Verify that the following fields auto-populate correctly:
   - City field should show the selected city
   - State field should show the selected state
   - ZIP Code field should show the selected zip code
   - Country field should show the selected country
8. Verify that the values persist and don't get reset when the page re-renders
9. Test saving the form to ensure the address data is properly saved

## Notes

- This fix addresses the root cause where the useEffect was resetting the form state after address selection
- The Google Places API deprecation warning is expected and doesn't affect functionality
- The fix ensures that user changes in edit mode are not overwritten by database fetches
