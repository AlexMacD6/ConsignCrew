## Testing Instructions

1. Pull this branch.
2. Run `npm install` to install Better Auth dependencies.
3. Set up environment variables in `.env.local`:
   ```
   DATABASE_URL=your_database_url
   GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=your_google_client_id
   GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET=your_google_client_secret
   ```
4. Start the application with `npm run dev`.
5. Navigate to `/register` and test:
   - Email/password registration (should create user in database)
   - Google OAuth registration (should redirect to Google)
   - Form validation and error handling
6. Navigate to `/login` and test:
   - Email/password login (should authenticate user)
   - Google OAuth login (should redirect to Google)
   - Error handling for invalid credentials
7. Verify navigation buttons work correctly.
8. Test that registration redirects to profile page on success.
9. Check that Better Auth API endpoints respond correctly at `/api/auth/[...betterauth]`.

**Note:** Google OAuth requires valid Google Cloud Console credentials to work properly.
