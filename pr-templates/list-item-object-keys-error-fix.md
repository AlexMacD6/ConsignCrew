## Root Cause

The error occurred because the `MediaPreview` component was trying to call `Object.values(photos)` before the `photos` prop was properly initialized. During the listing creation process, there's a brief moment where the photos state is `undefined` or `null`, causing the JavaScript error.

## Technical Details

**Error Location**: `app/components/MediaPreview.tsx`, line 55
**Error Type**: `TypeError: Cannot convert undefined or null to object`
**Trigger**: Calling `Object.values()` on undefined/null photos prop

**Fix Applied**:
1. Added null check: `photos ? Object.values(photos) : []`
2. Added conditional rendering: `{showPhotos && photos && (...)}` 
3. Fallback count: Shows `0` when photos is undefined

## Testing Instructions

1. Pull this branch and start the application with `npm run dev`
2. **Test list-item page functionality:**
   - Navigate to `/list-item` to create a new listing
   - Upload a video file (the error previously occurred after video processing)
   - Verify no JavaScript errors appear in console during auto form generation
   - Check that photo count displays correctly (should show "Uploaded Photos (0)" initially)
3. **Test with photos:**
   - Upload photos in different slots (hero, back, proof, additional)
   - Verify photo count updates correctly
   - Ensure PhotoDisplay component renders properly when photos are present
4. **Test state transitions:**
   - Toggle photo section visibility (show/hide)
   - Verify no errors during state changes
   - Check that component remains stable during form generation

## Edge Cases to Test

- Loading list-item page with no photos
- Rapid state changes during video processing  
- Form generation with various combinations of photos/videos
- Component mounting/unmounting during navigation
