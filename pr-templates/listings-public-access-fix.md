## Testing Instructions

1. Pull this branch and run `npm install`
2. Start the application with `npm run dev`
3. Test public access:
   - Visit `/listings` page without being logged in
   - Verify that all 8 active listings are displayed
   - Check that listing details, images, and prices are visible
4. Test authenticated access:
   - Log in and visit `/listings` page
   - Verify that listings are still displayed correctly
   - Test that all existing functionality works
5. Test API endpoint:
   - Make GET request to `/api/listings` without authentication
   - Verify response contains listings data with success: true
6. Test security:
   - Try to access non-active listings without authentication
   - Verify that 401 error is returned for non-active statuses

## Database Verification

Confirmed that the database contains:
- **8 active listings** with proper data structure
- **All listings have status: 'active'**
- **Proper user relationships** and photo data
- **Valid item IDs and metadata**

## Files Changed

- `app/api/listings/route.ts` - Modified GET endpoint to allow public access to active listings
- `requirements/listings-public-access-fix.txt` - Requirements documentation
- `pr-templates/listings-public-access-fix.md` - This PR template

## Security Considerations

- **Public Access**: Only active listings are publicly accessible
- **Authentication Required**: Non-active listings (sold, expired) still require authentication
- **Creation Protected**: POST requests for creating listings still require authentication
- **User Privacy**: No sensitive user information exposed in public listings

## Benefits

- **✅ Fixed Zero Listings Issue**: Page now displays all 8 active listings
- **✅ Improved User Experience**: Non-authenticated users can explore content
- **✅ Better Conversion**: Users can see value before signing up
- **✅ Maintained Security**: Sensitive operations still protected
- **✅ No Breaking Changes**: All existing functionality preserved
