## Testing Instructions

1. Pull this branch and run `npm install`
2. Run database migration: `npx prisma migrate dev`
3. Set up treasure code: `node scripts/setup-treasure-code.js`
4. Start the application: `npm run dev`
5. Test the redemption flow:
   - Visit `/redeem` and enter code "AB12CD"
   - Fill out the redemption form with test data
   - Verify success page displays correctly
   - Check admin dashboard at `/admin/treasure-redemptions`
6. Test admin functionality:
   - View redemption statistics
   - Mark payments as completed
   - Verify data updates correctly
7. Test validation:
   - Try invalid codes
   - Try duplicate redemptions
   - Verify proper error handling

## Database Changes

- Added `TreasureRedemption` table with fields for user info, payment details, and tracking
- Added `TreasureCode` table for managing redemption codes
- Both tables include proper indexing for performance

## API Endpoints

- **POST /api/treasure/redeem** - Process redemption submissions with validation
- **POST /api/treasure/validate-code** - Validate redemption codes before form display
- **GET /api/admin/treasure-redemptions** - Fetch admin dashboard data
- **POST /api/admin/treasure-redemptions/[id]/mark-paid** - Mark payments as completed

## Security Considerations

- Input validation using Zod schemas
- Duplicate prevention (one redemption per email/code)
- Rate limiting should be added in production
- Admin authentication should be implemented for production use

## Next Steps

- Add email notifications for redemptions
- Implement payment processing automation
- Add QR code generation for treasure envelopes
- Set up monitoring and alerts for redemption activity
