## Testing Instructions

1. Pull this branch and start the development server.
2. Create a new listing with photos in different categories (Electronics, Furniture, etc.).
3. Test the enhanced flaw detection:
   - Verify category-specific flaw types are detected
   - Check confidence levels are displayed
   - Test user feedback functionality
   - Verify normal wear patterns are not flagged as flaws

4. Test the enhanced ImageCarousel:
   - Hover over flaw tags to see detailed information
   - Click feedback buttons to mark flaws as accurate/inaccurate
   - Open modal to see detailed flaw information
   - Verify confidence indicators work correctly

5. Test different product categories:
   - Electronics: Look for screen cracks, water damage, etc.
   - Furniture: Look for wood damage, fabric stains, etc.
   - Clothing: Look for fabric tears, stains, missing buttons, etc.
   - Books: Look for page tears, water damage, binding issues, etc.

## Expected Behavior

### Enhanced Flaw Detection
- **Category-Specific Analysis**: Different flaw types detected based on product category
- **Reduced False Positives**: Normal wear patterns not flagged as flaws
- **Confidence Scoring**: Each flaw has a confidence percentage
- **Better Severity Assessment**: Severity based on impact on functionality and value

### Enhanced Display
- **Confidence Indicators**: Color-coded confidence levels on flaw tags
- **Detailed Information**: Hover tooltips with comprehensive flaw details
- **User Feedback**: Ability to mark flaws as accurate or inaccurate
- **Modal Details**: Enhanced flaw information in full-screen modal

### User Experience
- **Clear Information**: Users understand what each flaw means
- **Transparency**: Confidence levels show AI certainty
- **Feedback Loop**: Users can help improve accuracy
- **Better Trust**: More accurate assessments build user confidence
