## Changelog

### API Call Optimization
- Significantly reduced excessive API calls in PriceDropCounter component
  - Increased refresh delay from 2 seconds to 45 seconds after countdown completion
  - Added proper timeout management to prevent multiple simultaneous refreshes
  - Implemented adaptive countdown intervals based on duration

### Time Parsing Fixes
- Updated `parseTimeString` function to handle new day-based format
  - Added support for "3 days", "1 day", "Any moment now..." formats
  - Maintained backward compatibility with old hourly format
  - Fixed parsing errors that were causing incorrect countdown calculations

### Countdown Logic Improvements
- Implemented adaptive countdown intervals
  - 1 minute intervals for day-based countdowns (more efficient)
  - 1 second intervals for hour-based countdowns (responsive)
  - Reduced unnecessary timer updates for long-duration countdowns

### Memory Management
- Added proper cleanup for all timers and intervals
  - Clear existing intervals before setting new ones
  - Added `refreshTimeoutRef` to track and prevent duplicate refresh calls
  - Proper cleanup on component unmount to prevent memory leaks

### Performance Impact
- Reduced API calls by ~96% (from every 2 seconds to every 45 seconds)
- More efficient timer management for day-based countdowns
- Eliminated rapid API calls when countdown reaches zero

## Testing Instructions

1. **API Call Reduction Testing**:
   - Navigate to a listing with price drop schedule
   - Monitor network tab to verify reduced API calls (every 45 seconds)
   - Check that "Any moment now..." state doesn't trigger rapid calls

2. **Time Parsing Testing**:
   - Test with Turbo-30 schedule (should show "3 days", "6 days", etc.)
   - Test with Classic-60 schedule (should show "7 days", "14 days", etc.)
   - Verify "1 day" and "Any moment now..." formats work correctly

3. **Countdown Interval Testing**:
   - Verify day-based countdowns update every minute (not every second)
   - Check that hour-based countdowns remain responsive
   - Test countdown completion and refresh behavior

4. **Memory Leak Testing**:
   - Navigate between different listings
   - Verify proper cleanup when component unmounts
   - Check for any remaining timers in browser dev tools
