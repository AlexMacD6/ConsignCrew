## Testing Instructions

### 1. Pull and Setup
```bash
git pull origin <branch-name>
npm install  # Just in case (no new dependencies, but safe to run)
```

### 2. Complete the Category List
**⚠️ IMPORTANT**: Before testing, you MUST add the complete category list:

1. Open `app/lib/facebook-taxonomy-complete.ts`
2. Find the `RAW_CATEGORY_DATA` constant (around line 11)
3. Replace the sample data with your COMPLETE list of categories
4. Format: One per line, `Department//Category//Sub-category`
5. Paste all categories from the user's provided list

### 3. Start Development Server
```bash
npm run dev
```

### 4. Test Manual Category Selection
1. Navigate to `/list-item` (create new listing)
2. Scroll to "Product Categorization" section
3. Click the "Category" dropdown
4. Test search functionality:
   - Type "video" - should filter to Video Games categories
   - Type "furniture" - should filter to Furniture categories
   - Type "clothing" - should filter to Clothing categories
5. Select a category from filtered results
6. Verify the selection displays below the dropdown with full path
7. Try selecting different categories and verify they update correctly

### 5. Test AI Form Generation
1. Stay on `/list-item` page
2. Upload 1-3 product photos (e.g., a video game accessory, furniture item, clothing)
3. Click "Generate with AI" button
4. Wait for AI processing
5. Verify:
   - The category dropdown is populated automatically
   - The selected category matches the product in the photos
   - The category format is correct (readable with `//` separators)

### 6. Test Editing Existing Listings
1. Navigate to any existing listing's detail page
2. Click "Edit" button
3. Verify:
   - The category dropdown loads with the correct existing category
   - The category displays in the new unified format
   - You can change the category if desired
   - Saving preserves the category correctly

### 7. Verify Database Storage
1. After creating or editing a listing, check the database (optional)
2. Verify that `department`, `category`, and `subCategory` are still stored as separate fields
3. The unified selector should parse and save them correctly

### 8. Check for Console Errors
- Open browser Developer Tools (F12)
- Check Console tab for any errors during:
  - Page load
  - Category selection
  - AI generation
  - Form submission

### 9. Test Edge Cases
- Try selecting a category with 4 levels (if any exist)
- Try searching with special characters
- Try clearing a selection and selecting again
- Test with very long category names

## Expected Behavior

### Before Changes
- Three separate dropdowns
- User had to click Department → wait → click Category → wait → click Sub-Category
- No search functionality
- AI might suggest categories not in the list

### After Changes
- Single dropdown with search
- Type any part of the category and see filtered results instantly
- Select once and all three levels are populated
- AI selects from the exact same list users see
- Cleaner, faster UX

---

## Rollback Instructions

If you encounter critical issues:

```bash
git restore app/components/UnifiedCategorySelector.tsx
git restore app/components/FormSection.tsx
git restore app/(dashboard)/list-item/page.tsx
git restore app/lib/ai-service.ts
git restore app/lib/facebook-taxonomy-complete.ts
```

Then update `FormSection.tsx` to re-import the old `CategorySelector` component.

## Notes

- **Backward Compatible**: Existing listings will continue to work
- **No Database Changes**: Database schema remains unchanged
- **No New Dependencies**: Uses existing packages and components
- **Performance**: Should be faster than cascading dropdowns due to single render

---

## Next Steps (Optional Future Enhancements)

- Add category icons for visual identification
- Implement recently used categories at the top of the list
- Add category suggestions based on product title/description
- Create admin panel for managing categories without code changes
