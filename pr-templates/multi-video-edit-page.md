## Testing Instructions

1. Pull this branch and install dependencies with `npm install`
2. Start the development server with `npm run dev`
3. Navigate to an existing listing edit page: `/list-item/{LISTING_ID}/edit`

5. **Video Management Panel**: Check that videos show in the right panel with thumbnails
6. **Video Removal**: Test removing videos using the X button

### Test Video Upload
7. **Empty State**: For listings without videos, test both single upload and "Upload Multiple Videos"
8. **Bulk Upload**: Test uploading multiple videos using drag-and-drop and file selection
9. **Additional Videos**: After uploading one video, test "Add More Videos" functionality
10. **Upload Progress**: Verify progress bars and status indicators work correctly

### Test Integration
