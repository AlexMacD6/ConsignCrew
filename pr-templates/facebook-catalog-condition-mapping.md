# Facebook Catalog Condition Mapping Enhancement

## Changelog

- **Enhanced Facebook Catalog Sync**: Added intelligent condition mapping to ensure Facebook receives condition values in their exact expected format
- **Condition Value Standardization**: Implemented comprehensive mapping from our condition values to Facebook's required format:
  - New → "New"
  - Refurbished → "Refurbished" 
  - Used (like new) → "Used (like new)"
  - Used (good) → "Used (good)"
  - Used (fair) → "Used (fair)"
- **Smart Fallback Logic**: Added intelligent pattern matching and fallbacks for unknown condition values
- **Enhanced Debug Logging**: Added detailed logging to show both original and mapped condition values
- **URL Integration**: Confirmed website link integration is working (already implemented)
- **Environment Configuration**: Added `NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL` to `env.example` for proper documentation

## Technical Changes

### **New Function Added**
- `mapConditionToFacebook()` function in `app/lib/facebook-catalog-sync.ts`
- Handles comprehensive condition value mapping with fallbacks
- Prevents Facebook API validation errors

### **Updated Functions**
- **Create Function**: Now uses mapped condition values
- **Update Function**: Now uses mapped condition values
- **Debug Logging**: Enhanced to show condition mapping process

### **Files Modified**
- `app/lib/facebook-catalog-sync.ts` - Added condition mapping function and updated sync logic
- `env.example` - Added `NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL` environment variable
- `requirements/facebook-catalog-url-integration.txt` - Updated to include condition mapping

## Testing Instructions

1. **Pull this branch** and run `npm install`
2. **Set environment variable**: `NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL=https://treasurehub.club`
3. **Create a new listing** with Facebook Shop enabled and various condition values
4. **Check console logs** for condition mapping debug information:
   ```
   condition: {
     original: "used like new",
     mapped: "Used (like new)"
   }
   ```
5. **Verify Facebook sync** by checking Facebook Commerce Manager
6. **Test different condition values** to ensure proper mapping:
   - "new" → "New"
   - "mint" → "Used (like new)"
   - "excellent" → "Used (like new)"
   - "good" → "Used (good)"
   - "fair" → "Used (fair)"
7. **Check for unknown conditions** - should default to "Used (good)" with console warnings

## Expected Results

- **Facebook Catalog**: All products now have properly formatted condition values
- **API Validation**: No more Facebook API condition-related errors
- **Data Consistency**: Facebook receives condition data in their exact expected format
- **Debug Visibility**: Console logs show both original and mapped condition values
- **URL Integration**: Website links continue to work as before
