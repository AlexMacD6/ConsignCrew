# Meta Pixel Production Optimization

## Changelog

- **Event Deduplication**: Added unique event_id using UUID v4 for all Meta Pixel events
  - Prevents duplicate event counting when both browser and server-side tracking fire
  - Updated `trackMetaPixelEvent` to generate and pass event_id to both browser and CAPI
  - Enhanced server-side API to handle event_id parameter

- **Optimized Fallback Logic**: Improved browser vs server-side tracking logic
  - Added `browserSent` flag to track browser success
  - Skip server-side API calls when browser tracking succeeds
  - Reduced redundant API calls and improved performance

- **Enhanced Data Quality**: Improved event data completeness and structure
  - Added `action_source: 'website'` to all server-side events
  - Enhanced ViewContent tracking with additional Facebook Shop catalog fields
  - Improved type safety with stricter TypeScript interfaces

- **Stricter TypeScript Types**: Created proper interfaces for better type safety
  - Created `ProductEvent` interface with required `content_ids` field
  - Created `CartItem` interface for purchase events
  - Made `search_string` required for Search events
  - Made `value` required for Purchase events

- **Removed Duplicate Initialization**: Eliminated potential duplicate pixel instances
  - Removed `initMetaPixel()` function that could create duplicate instances
  - Kept only automatic initialization in `MetaPixelScript.tsx`

- **Enhanced Cart/Purchase Events**: Added support for Facebook's preferred format
  - Added `createContentsArray()` helper function for cart items
  - Updated `trackPurchase()` to support contents array with item details
  - Improved purchase event data structure for better match quality

- **Environment Variable Guards**: Added proper validation for missing configuration
  - Added pixel ID validation in `MetaPixelScript.tsx`
  - Skip browser tracking if pixel ID is missing
  - Improved error logging and warnings

- **Dependencies**: Added UUID package for event ID generation
  - Installed `uuid` and `@types/uuid` packages
  - Used for generating unique event identifiers

## Testing Instructions

### 1. Event Deduplication Testing
1. Open browser developer tools and navigate to a product page
2. Check console logs for "Meta Pixel: Attempting to track ViewContent"
3. Verify event_id is generated and logged
4. Check Facebook Events Manager to ensure no duplicate events

### 2. Fallback Logic Testing
1. Enable an ad blocker to block Facebook Pixel
2. Navigate to a product page and check console logs
3. Verify server-side fallback is triggered
4. Disable ad blocker and verify browser tracking works
5. Confirm server-side calls only happen when browser fails

### 3. Data Quality Testing
1. Navigate to various product pages with different data
2. Check console logs for complete event data
3. Verify all required fields are present
4. Test with products missing optional fields (brand, condition, etc.)

### 4. Type Safety Testing
1. Run `npm run build` to check TypeScript compilation
2. Verify no type errors related to Meta Pixel functions
3. Test with missing required fields (should show TypeScript errors)

### 5. Environment Variable Testing
1. Temporarily remove `NEXT_PUBLIC_META_PIXEL_ID` from .env
2. Restart development server
3. Verify console shows warning about missing pixel ID
4. Confirm browser tracking is skipped gracefully

### 6. Performance Testing
1. Monitor network tab for Meta Pixel API calls
2. Verify server-side calls only happen when needed
3. Check for reduced API call frequency compared to previous version

## Files Modified

- `app/lib/meta-pixel-client.ts` - Core tracking functions with deduplication
- `app/components/MetaPixelScript.tsx` - Script initialization with guards
- `app/api/meta/conversion/route.ts` - Server-side API with event_id support
- `app/(dashboard)/list-item/[id]/page.tsx` - ViewContent tracking with new types
- `package.json` - Added uuid dependencies
- `requirements/meta-pixel-production-optimization.txt` - Requirements documentation

---

## Breaking Changes

- **TypeScript**: Some function signatures now require stricter types
  - `trackViewContent` now requires `content_ids` field
  - `trackSearch` now requires `search_string` field
  - `trackPurchase` now requires `value` field

- **API**: Server-side events now include `event_id` and `action_source` parameters

---

## Performance Impact

- **Positive**: Reduced server load from fewer redundant API calls
- **Positive**: Better event deduplication improves Facebook match quality
- **Positive**: Enhanced data completeness for better conversion tracking
- **Neutral**: Minimal impact on client-side performance

---

## Monitoring

After deployment, monitor:
- Facebook Events Manager for event delivery success
- Server-side API call frequency
- Browser vs server-side tracking ratios
- Event completeness scores in Facebook
