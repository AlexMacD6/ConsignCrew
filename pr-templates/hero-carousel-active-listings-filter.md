## Technical Details

### Filtering Logic
The carousel now applies multiple filters:
- `hasHeroPhoto`: Ensures listing has a displayable image
- `isActiveStatus`: Status must be 'active', 'listed', or 'available'
- `isNotSold`: Excludes 'sold' and 'completed' listings
- `isNotProcessing`: Excludes 'processing' listings

### Fallback Display
When no active listings are available:
- Shows TreasureHub logo at 24px height with 80% opacity
- Displays branded messaging consistent with site theme
- Provides two action buttons: "View All Listings" and "List Your Item"
- Uses gradient background for visual appeal

   - Clear the listings database to have no items
5. Refresh the landing page and verify:
