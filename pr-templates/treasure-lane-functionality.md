### AI Treasure Detection
- Automatically flags items as treasures when:
  - No modern MSRP available
  - Condition = "used" and age > 20 years
  - Vintage, antique, or collector appeal detected
  - Discontinued or rare models identified
- Sets `estimatedRetailPrice` to null for treasures
- Provides treasure reasoning and comparable sales data

### UI/UX Enhancements
- **Treasure Badge**: Gold gradient badge with "Treasure • One-of-a-Kind" text
- **Price Context**: Shows comparable sales instead of retail discounts
- **Filter Toggle**: "Treasures Only" filter for collectors
- **Consistent Branding**: Treasure badges appear in listing cards and detail pages

### Database Changes
- Migration: `add_treasure_fields_to_listing`
- New fields: `isTreasure` (boolean), `treasureReason` (string), `treasureFlaggedAt` (DateTime), `treasureFlaggedBy` (string)
- Maintains backward compatibility with existing listings

## Testing Instructions

1. **Database Migration**
   - Pull this branch and run `npx prisma migrate dev`
   - Verify new fields are added to Listing table
   - Confirm existing listings have `isTreasure = false` by default

2. **AI Treasure Detection**
   - Create a new listing with a vintage item (20+ years old, used condition)
   - Verify AI automatically sets `isTreasure = true`
   - Check that `estimatedRetailPrice` is set to null
   - Confirm `treasureReason` contains appropriate explanation

3. **Frontend Display**
   - View a treasure listing in the listings grid
   - Verify gold "Treasure • One-of-a-Kind" badge appears
   - Check that no retail price discount is shown
   - Confirm "Based on recent collector sales" text appears

4. **Listing Detail Page**
   - Navigate to a treasure listing detail page
   - Verify treasure badge appears in price section
   - Check that treasure reason is displayed
   - Confirm comparable sales information is shown

5. **Filtering Functionality**
   - Go to listings page
   - Click "Treasures Only" filter toggle
   - Verify only treasure items are displayed
   - Toggle back to "Show All" and confirm all items appear

6. **API Integration**
   - Create a new listing with treasure fields
   - Verify treasure data is saved to database
   - Check that treasure fields are returned in API responses
   - Test listing update with treasure fields

7. **Edge Cases**
   - Test with items that are borderline treasure/regular
   - Verify treasure items don't show retail price calculations
   - Check that treasure badges don't appear on non-treasure items
   - Test filter behavior with mixed treasure/regular listings

## Technical Notes
