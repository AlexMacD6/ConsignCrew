## Testing Instructions

1. Pull this branch and run `npm install` to ensure all dependencies are up to date.

2. Start the development server with `npm run dev`.

3. Navigate to the profile page (`/profile`) and test the address autocomplete:
   - Click "Edit" to enter edit mode
   - In the "Street Address" field, start typing an address
   - Verify that the address dropdown populates with suggestions
   - Select an address from the dropdown
   - Confirm that all address fields (Street Address, City, State, ZIP Code, Country) are populated correctly
   - Verify that the form data persists and displays properly after selection

4. Test error handling:
   - Check browser console for any TypeScript compilation errors
   - Verify that loading states display correctly during API initialization
   - Test with invalid API key to ensure proper error messages

5. Test form validation:
   - Try to save the profile without filling required address fields
   - Verify that validation errors display correctly
   - Test successful profile update with populated address data

6. Check for hydration errors:
   - Verify no console errors related to HTML structure
   - Ensure the page renders correctly without hydration mismatches

## Technical Notes

- This implementation uses Google Maps API `v=beta` for Web Component support
- PlaceAutocompleteElement is implemented as a Web Component (`<gmp-place-autocomplete>`) not a class
- The Web Component approach provides better performance and future compatibility
- Previous InvalidValueError was resolved by using the correct Web Component implementation
