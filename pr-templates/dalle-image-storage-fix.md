## Testing Instructions

1. Pull this branch and run `npm install` to ensure all dependencies are up to date.

2. Verify environment variables are configured:
   ```
   OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key
   AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=your_aws_access_key
   AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=your_aws_secret_key
   AWS_REGION=us-east-1
   S3_BUCKET=your_s3_bucket_name
   ```

3. Start the application with `npm run dev`.

4. Test DALL-E image generation:
   - Navigate to a listing creation page
   - Trigger DALL-E image generation
   - Verify the generated image URL is from S3 (cloudfront.net)
   - Check console logs for download and upload confirmation messages

5. Test S3 upload failure scenarios:
   - Temporarily break AWS credentials to test S3 upload failure
   - Verify that no image is shown when S3 upload fails
   - Check console logs for appropriate error messages
   - Confirm no broken images or placeholders appear

6. Test image loading performance:
   - Generate multiple DALL-E images
   - Verify acceptable response times for the new download/upload flow
   - Check that S3 images load properly through CloudFront CDN

7. Verify visual indicators:
   - Successfully loaded S3 images should show "S3 Stored" indicator
   - Failed images should not appear at all (no fallback placeholders)
   - Loading states should display properly

8. Test UI cleanliness:
   - Verify no broken images are shown anywhere in the application
   - Confirm no fallback placeholders or error images appear
   - Check that the UI remains clean even when images fail to load

## Breaking Changes

- **Removed Azure fallback**: Images that fail to upload to S3 will not be shown
- **Cleaner UI**: No more broken images or fallback placeholders
- **Simplified logic**: Only S3-stored images are supported

---

## Performance Impact

- **Slight increase in image generation time**: Additional ~2-5 seconds for download and upload operations
- **Improved image loading performance**: S3 images load faster through CloudFront CDN
- **Better reliability**: No more broken images due to expired URLs
- **Reduced server load**: Permanent storage reduces repeated generation requests
- **Cleaner UI**: No broken images cluttering the interface

---

## Security Considerations

- No new security vulnerabilities introduced
- Uses existing S3 authentication and authorization
- Maintains secure pre-signed URL approach for uploads
- No exposure of AWS credentials in frontend

---

## Monitoring

- Console logs now include detailed information about download and upload operations
- Error tracking for both Azure download and S3 upload failures
- Visual indicators in UI for S3-stored images only
- Clean failures - no broken images to monitor
