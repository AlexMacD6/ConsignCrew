## Testing Instructions

1. Pull this branch and start the application with `npm run dev`
2. **Test inventory selector display:**
   - Navigate to the list-item page (`/list-item`)
   - Click on "Select from Inventory" or similar button to open inventory modal
   - Search for "midea" or any inventory items
   - Verify that quantity is now displayed in the format "Qty: X"
3. **Test quantity color coding:**
   - Look for items with different stock levels:
     - Items with 0 quantity should show in red
     - Items with 1-5 quantity should show in orange  
     - Items with 6+ quantity should show in green
4. **Verify functionality:**
   - Ensure inventory selection still works correctly
   - Confirm search and pagination still function
   - Check that selected items are properly highlighted

## Visual Changes

- Quantity now appears in the item details line: "Item #: XXX | Vendor: XXX | MSRP: $XX.XX | Qty: X"
- Quantity text uses color coding for quick visual assessment of stock levels
- Font weight is medium to make quantity stand out from other metadata
