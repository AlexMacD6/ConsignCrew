## Testing Instructions

1. Pull this branch and run `npm install`
2. Start the application with `npm run dev`
3. Open browser developer tools and check the console for any Meta Pixel errors
4. Test the following scenarios:
   - With Meta Pixel ID configured: Verify events track properly without errors
   - Without Meta Pixel ID: Verify app works normally without errors
   - With invalid Meta Pixel ID: Verify graceful error handling
5. Test page load and email subscription to ensure tracking works
6. Verify that the "window.fbq is not a function" error no longer appears
