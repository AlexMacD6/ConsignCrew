## Changelog

### Added Date Filtering to Sales Analytics Module

Added comprehensive date range filtering capability to the Sales Analytics module in the Admin Dashboard, allowing administrators to filter sales data by specific date ranges.

#### API Changes
- Updated `GET /api/admin/sales-analytics` endpoint to accept date filter query parameters:
  - `startDate`: ISO date string (YYYY-MM-DD) - filter sales from this date (inclusive, start of day)
  - `endDate`: ISO date string (YYYY-MM-DD) - filter sales to this date (inclusive, end of day)
- Modified database query to filter `soldAt` dates based on provided parameters
- Maintains backward compatibility - when no dates provided, returns all-time data

#### UI Changes
- Added date filter section at the top of Sales Analytics page with:
  - **Preset dropdown** with 11 common date ranges:
    - All Time (default)
    - Today
    - Yesterday
    - This Week
    - Last Week
    - This Month
    - Last Month
    - Last 3 Months
    - Last 6 Months
    - This Year
    - Last Year
    - Custom Range
  - **Start Date picker**: Manual date selection
  - **End Date picker**: Manual date selection
  - **Apply button**: Refreshes analytics with selected date range
  - **Clear button**: Resets to all-time view
- Added active filter display showing current date range
- Automatic refresh when dates change via useEffect
- Brand-consistent styling using `#D4AF3D` accent color

#### Features
- **Smart date handling**:
  - Start date includes beginning of day (00:00:00)
  - End date includes end of day (23:59:59)
  - Prevents data gaps at day boundaries
- **Preset calculations**:
  - All presets calculate dates relative to current day
  - Week starts on Sunday (standard JavaScript behavior)
  - Month/year boundaries handled correctly
- **UX enhancements**:
  - Selecting custom dates automatically switches preset to "Custom Range"
  - Clear button disabled when no filters active
  - Loading state on Apply button
  - Responsive layout for mobile devices

#### Affected Components
- `app/admin/sales-analytics/page.tsx` - Added date filter UI and state management
- `app/api/admin/sales-analytics/route.ts` - Added date filter query support

## Testing Instructions

### Prerequisites
1. Pull this branch
2. Start the application: `npm run dev`
3. Ensure you have some sales data in your database with varying `soldAt` dates

### Test Scenarios

#### 1. Test Preset Date Ranges
1. Navigate to Admin Dashboard â†’ Sales Analytics (`/admin/sales-analytics`)
2. Verify the date filter section appears at the top
3. Test each preset option:
   - Select "Today" - verify it shows only today's sales
   - Select "Yesterday" - verify it shows only yesterday's sales
   - Select "This Week" - verify it shows sales from Sunday to today
   - Select "Last Week" - verify it shows previous week (Sun-Sat)
   - Select "This Month" - verify it shows sales from 1st of month to today
   - Select "Last Month" - verify it shows the entire previous month
   - Select "Last 3 Months" - verify 3-month range
   - Select "Last 6 Months" - verify 6-month range
   - Select "This Year" - verify from Jan 1 to today
   - Select "Last Year" - verify entire previous calendar year
   - Select "All Time" - verify all sales shown

#### 2. Test Custom Date Range
1. Click on the "Start Date" input
2. Select a specific start date
3. Verify the preset dropdown changes to "Custom Range"
4. Click on the "End Date" input
5. Select a specific end date
6. Click "Apply"
7. Verify:
   - Analytics data updates to show only sales within the selected range
   - Active filter display shows selected dates
   - All metrics (revenue, sales count, charts, etc.) reflect filtered data

#### 3. Test Date Input Interaction
1. Select a preset (e.g., "This Month")
2. Verify start and end date inputs populate automatically
3. Manually change the start date
4. Verify preset changes to "Custom Range"
5. Verify "Apply" button updates the data

#### 4. Test Clear Functionality
1. Set any date filter (preset or custom)
2. Verify the "Clear" button is enabled
3. Click "Clear"
4. Verify:
   - Start and end date inputs are empty
   - Preset returns to "All Time"
   - Analytics refreshes to show all-time data
   - Clear button becomes disabled

#### 5. Test Edge Cases
1. **Empty date range**: Leave both dates empty and click Apply
   - Should show all-time data
2. **Start date only**: Set start date without end date
   - Should show all sales from start date to now
3. **End date only**: Set end date without start date
   - Should show all sales from beginning to end date
4. **Inverted range**: Set end date before start date
   - Should still work (API handles this gracefully)
5. **Same start and end**: Set both to the same date
   - Should show only that day's sales

#### 6. Test UI Responsiveness
1. Resize browser window to mobile size
2. Verify date filter section remains usable
3. Verify inputs stack vertically on small screens
4. Test all functionality on mobile layout

#### 7. Test Data Accuracy
1. Note a specific sale's `soldAt` date in the database
2. Set date range that includes that date
3. Verify the sale appears in:
   - Sales count
   - Revenue total
   - Sales list table
   - Monthly chart (if applicable)
4. Set date range that excludes that date
5. Verify the sale does NOT appear in any metrics

#### 8. Test Performance
1. Select "All Time" with large dataset
2. Verify page loads without errors
3. Switch to "This Month"
4. Verify faster load time with smaller dataset
5. Monitor browser console for errors

### Visual Verification
- Date filter section has clean, professional appearance
- Inputs aligned properly in desktop and mobile views
- Brand color `#D4AF3D` used for Apply button
- Calendar icon appears next to "Date Range" label
- Active filter display shows clearly when filters applied
- Loading spinner appears on Apply button during fetch

### API Verification (Optional)
Test API directly using browser or Postman:

```bash
# All time (no parameters)
GET /api/admin/sales-analytics

# Specific date range
GET /api/admin/sales-analytics?startDate=2025-01-01&endDate=2025-01-31

# Start date only
GET /api/admin/sales-analytics?startDate=2025-01-01

# End date only
GET /api/admin/sales-analytics?endDate=2025-01-31
```

Verify response data matches expected filtered results.

### Expected Behavior
- All charts and metrics should update based on filtered date range
- Monthly breakdown chart should only show months within the selected range
- Payment/fulfillment method breakdowns should reflect filtered data
- Top categories should recalculate based on filtered sales
- Sales list table should show only sales within date range
- Export to CSV should export only filtered data
