## Testing Instructions

1. Pull this branch and run `npm install` to update dependencies.
2. Run the zip code migration: `node scripts/migrate-zipcodes.js`
3. Start the application with `npm run dev`.
4. Log in as an admin user and navigate to the Profile page.
5. Click on the "Admin" tab and then "Content" sub-tab.
6. Test zip code management functionality:
   - **Add new zip code**: Fill out the form and click "Add"
   - **Edit existing zip code**: Click the edit button on any zip code, modify fields, and save
   - **Delete zip code**: Click the delete button and confirm deletion
   - **Validation**: Try adding zip codes with missing fields
   - **API integration**: Verify changes persist after page refresh
7. Test backward compatibility:
   - Verify existing pages using zip codes still work
   - Check that fallback data is used if API is unavailable
8. Test admin access control:
   - Verify only admin users can access zip code management
   - Test with non-admin users to ensure they cannot access the functionality

## Database Changes

- Uses existing ZipCode model in Prisma schema
- No new migrations required (table already exists)
- Migration script populates table with existing hardcoded data

## API Endpoints Used

- GET /api/admin/zipcodes - List all zip codes
- POST /api/admin/zipcodes - Add new zip code
- PUT /api/admin/zipcodes - Update existing zip code
- DELETE /api/admin/zipcodes - Delete zip code

## Breaking Changes

None - all changes maintain backward compatibility with existing synchronous functions.
