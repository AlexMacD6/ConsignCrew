## Testing Instructions

1. **Database Migration**:
   - Run `npx prisma migrate dev` to apply schema changes
   - Verify new Facebook Shop fields are added to Listing table
   - Verify FacebookApiKey table is created

2. **API Key Management**:
   - Navigate to `/admin/facebook-shop`
   - Create a new API key with a descriptive name
   - Verify the API key is displayed and can be copied
   - Test editing the API key name
   - Test deleting an API key

3. **Product Feed Endpoint**:
   - Test `/api/facebook-shop/feed?api_key=YOUR_API_KEY`
   - Verify JSON response contains properly formatted product data
   - Check that only enabled listings are included
   - Verify rate limiting works (should reject after 1000 requests/hour)

4. **Health Check Endpoint**:
   - Test `/api/facebook-shop/health?api_key=YOUR_API_KEY`
   - Verify response includes statistics and API key usage info
   - Check database connectivity status

5. **Admin Dashboard Integration**:
   - Navigate to main admin dashboard
   - Click on "Facebook Shop" tab
   - Verify quick setup guide is displayed
   - Test "Manage Integration" button links to Facebook Shop page

6. **Data Mapping**:
   - Create a test listing with various categories and conditions
   - Verify the feed properly maps categories and conditions
   - Check that Facebook Shop IDs are generated correctly

7. **Security Testing**:
   - Test feed endpoint without API key (should return 401)
   - Test with invalid API key (should return 401)
   - Test rate limiting by making multiple requests
   - Verify CORS headers are set correctly

8. **Facebook Integration Setup**:
   - Copy the feed URL from the admin interface
   - Set up Facebook Business Manager (manual process)
   - Configure product catalog with the feed URL
   - Verify products appear in Facebook Shop

## Security Considerations

- API keys are cryptographically secure (32-byte random hex)
- Rate limiting prevents abuse (1000 requests/hour per key)
- CORS headers allow Facebook servers to access feed
- API key validation on all endpoints
- Usage tracking and monitoring implemented

## Facebook Shop Setup Process

1. **Create API Key**: Use the admin interface to generate a secure API key
2. **Facebook Business Manager**: Set up Facebook Business Manager account
3. **Product Catalog**: Create a product catalog in Facebook Commerce Manager
4. **Feed Configuration**: Add the feed URL with API key to Facebook
5. **Product Review**: Facebook will review products before publishing
6. **Monitor Sync**: Use admin interface to monitor sync status and usage

## Dependencies Added

- No new npm dependencies required
- Uses existing crypto module for API key generation
- Uses existing Prisma for database operations
- Uses existing Next.js API routes and components

## Notes

- Facebook Shop integration requires manual setup in Facebook Business Manager
- Product approval process is handled by Facebook (not automated)
- Feed updates are real-time when Facebook requests the feed
- API keys should be kept secure and not shared publicly
- Monitor usage statistics to ensure proper rate limit compliance
