## Testing Instructions

1. Pull this branch.
2. Run `npm install` to install the new AWS SES dependency.
3. Configure environment variables:
   - Set `SES_FROM_EMAIL` to a verified SES sender email (e.g., noreply@treasurehub.club)
   - Set `CONTACT_FORM_EMAIL` to the recipient email (e.g., support@treasurehub.club)
   - Ensure AWS credentials are configured (`AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`, `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`)
4. Start the application with `npm run dev`.
5. Navigate to `/contact` in the browser.
6. Fill out and submit the contact form with:
   - Valid name, email, subject, and message
   - Check server console for email sending logs
   - Verify email is received at the configured recipient address
7. Test error scenarios:
   - Submit form with invalid email format (should show validation error)
   - Test with missing AWS credentials (should show configuration error)
   - Test with unverified sender domain (should show SES error)
8. Verify that the application builds without AWS SDK bundling errors
