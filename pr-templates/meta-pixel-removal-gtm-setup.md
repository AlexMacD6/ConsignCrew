## Testing Instructions

1. Pull this branch and run `npm install`
2. Start the application with `npm run dev`
3. Open browser developer tools and verify:
   - No Meta Pixel related errors in console
   - Google Tag Manager loads properly
   - Google Analytics tracking still works
4. Test the following functionality:
   - Email subscription form (should work without Meta Pixel tracking)
   - Contact form (should work without Meta Pixel tracking)
   - Page navigation and routing
   - All existing features and components
5. Verify that the application functions normally without any Meta Pixel dependencies

## Environment Variables

The following Meta Pixel environment variables have been removed:
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_META_PIXEL_ID`
- `META_ACCESS_TOKEN`
- `META_API_VERSION`

No new environment variables are required for this change.

## Google Tag Manager Setup

The application now relies on Google Tag Manager for all tracking needs:
- GTM ID: `GTM-T9SC7WZX` (already configured)
- Google Analytics 4 ID: `G-B483BLYZEF` (already configured)
- All future tracking implementations should be done through GTM interface
