# Fix: Allow Receiving Items from Any Status (Not Just Manifested)

## Issue

When trying to receive items that were previously marked as TRASH or USE, the modal showed "Max: 0" and prevented allocation, saying "You can allocate up to 0 manifested items to RECEIVED status."

**Problem:** Users could only receive manifested items, not reallocate items from other statuses (TRASH/USE) back to RECEIVED.

## Root Cause

In the `openModal()` function, the `maxQty` logic was treating RECEIVED differently:

```typescript
// Before - WRONG
if (type === "RECEIVED") {
  maxQty = manifested;  // Only manifested items
} else if (type === "TRASH") {
  maxQty = total;  // Any items
} else {
  maxQty = total;  // Any items
}
```

This meant:
- **TRASH** and **USE** could reallocate from total quantity ✅
- **RECEIVED** could only allocate from manifested items ❌

## Solution

Changed all disposition types to allow reallocation from the total quantity:

```typescript
// After - CORRECT
// All disposition types can now reallocate from the total quantity
// The API will automatically deallocate from other statuses as needed
maxQty = total;
```

### Updated Modal Message

Also updated the modal message to be consistent across all disposition types:

**Before:**
```typescript
{modal.type === "RECEIVED" &&
  `You can allocate up to ${modal.maxQuantity} manifested items to RECEIVED status.`}
```

**After:**
```typescript
{modal.type === "RECEIVED" &&
  `Setting new total for RECEIVED status (current: ${
    modal.item.receivedQuantity || 0
  }). Max: ${modal.maxQuantity}`}
```

## How It Works Now

### Example: Item with 2 units trashed

**Before (Broken):**
1. Item has: Total: 2, Received: 0, Trashed: 2, Manifested: 0
2. Click "Receive" button
3. Modal shows: "Max: 0" ❌
4. Cannot receive any items

**After (Fixed):**
1. Item has: Total: 2, Received: 0, Trashed: 2, Manifested: 0
2. Click "Receive" button
3. Modal shows: "Max: 2" ✅
4. Can set Received to 2
5. API automatically moves 2 from TRASH to RECEIVED
6. Result: Total: 2, Received: 2, Trashed: 0, Manifested: 0

## API Reallocation Logic

The backend API (`PUT /api/admin/inventory/items/[id]/disposition`) already had the logic to automatically deallocate from other statuses:

```typescript
// If we need more than what's manifested, we need to deallocate from other statuses
if (neededChange > manifestedQty) {
  const needToDeallocate = neededChange - manifestedQty;
  
  // Deallocate from other statuses (FIFO - first status with quantity)
  for (const disp of item.dispositions) {
    if (disp.status !== status && remainingToDeallocate > 0) {
      // Reduce or delete other disposition
    }
  }
}
```

The frontend was unnecessarily restricting RECEIVED to only manifested items.

## User Experience

### All Actions Now Work the Same Way

| Action | What You Can Do |
|--------|-----------------|
| **Receive** | Set total RECEIVED quantity up to item's total (reallocates from TRASH/USE if needed) |
| **Trash** | Set total TRASH quantity up to item's total (reallocates from RECEIVED/USE if needed) |
| **Use** | Set total USE quantity up to item's total (reallocates from RECEIVED/TRASH if needed) |

### Common Workflows Now Supported

**Workflow 1: Undo Trash Decision**
1. Accidentally trashed 2 items
2. Click "Receive" → Set to 2
3. Items moved from TRASH to RECEIVED ✅

**Workflow 2: Split Allocation**
1. Item has 5 units, all manifested
2. Receive 3 → 3 RECEIVED, 2 manifested
3. Later trash 1 → 2 RECEIVED, 1 TRASH, 2 manifested
4. Later receive 1 more → 3 RECEIVED, 1 TRASH, 1 manifested

**Workflow 3: Reallocate from Use to Receive**
1. Item marked for USE (personal/business)
2. Change mind, want to sell it
3. Click "Receive" → Set to quantity
4. Items moved from USE to RECEIVED ✅

## Modal Display

The modal now shows:
```
KOHLER 47L KITCHEN CAN
Item #1806294

Total: 2
Received: 0
Trashed: 2
Used: 0
Manifested: 0

Setting new total for RECEIVED status (current: 0). Max: 2

Quantity: [2]
Max: 2
```

## Testing

1. Create a test item with 2 units
2. Mark both as TRASH
3. Verify: Trashed: 2, Received: 0, Manifested: 0
4. Click "Receive" button
5. Verify modal shows "Max: 2"
6. Set quantity to 2
7. Click "Receive"
8. Verify: Trashed: 0, Received: 2, Manifested: 0 ✅
