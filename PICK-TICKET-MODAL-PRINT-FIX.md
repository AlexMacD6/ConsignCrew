# Pick Ticket Modal Print Fix

## Summary
Reverted back to using the modal approach with `window.print()` to fix the PDF duplication issue while maintaining the proper CustomQRCode component and adding the black logo with Poppins font support.

## Changes Made

### 1. Reverted Print Function
- Simplified `handlePrint` function back to just `window.print()`
- Removed the complex print window approach that was causing formatting issues
- The modal content now prints directly with proper CSS controls

### 2. Added Black Logo to Print Header
- Updated the print title section to include the black TreasureHub logo
- Logo is positioned to the left of "WAREHOUSE PICK TICKET" text
- Only visible when printing (using `print-show` class)

```jsx
<div className="hidden print-show print-title">
  <div className="flex items-center justify-center mb-4 pb-2 border-b-2 border-black">
    <img
      src="/TreasureHub - Banner - Label.png"
      alt="TreasureHub"
      className="h-16 mr-4"
    />
    <div className="text-2xl font-bold">WAREHOUSE PICK TICKET</div>
  </div>
</div>
```

### 3. Enhanced Print CSS in globals.css
- Added comprehensive print styles using `@media print`
- Ensured Poppins font is used throughout the printed document
- Proper page setup (8.5" x 11" with 0.5" margins)
- Print-specific classes for show/hide elements:
  - `.print-hide` - hides modal controls during print
  - `.print-show` - shows print-only elements
  - `.print-title`, `.print-section`, `.print-grid`, etc.

### 4. Key Print Features
- **Font**: Poppins used consistently throughout the printed document
- **Logo**: Black TreasureHub logo (no colored ink needed)
- **QR Code**: Uses the actual `CustomQRCode` component (same as modal)
- **Layout**: Proper 8.5" x 11" formatting that fits on one page
- **No Duplication**: Single clean print output

## Files Modified
