For every branch, maintain a PR template markdown file in the pr-templates/ directory.

The template must include:

A changelog section that summarizes all changes made in the branch.

Simple, clear testing instructions for reviewers.

Keep all language factual and to the pointâ€”avoid marketing terms or unnecessary detail.

Update the changelog and instructions as changes are made.
