For all requests, remind the user to document the requirements in a text file within the `requirements/` directory (if they haven't already).

The requirements text file should clearly describe the requested changes or features using bullets.

This requirements file should then be included in the Cursor prompt, rather than the user manually writing the request.

If the requirements file is not referenced or provided, the user should be reminded to create and include one before work proceeds.

This practice ensures all original requirements are version controlled and available for reviewers, making it easy to understand the goal of the changes versus the resulting output.
