Code Commenting Guidelines

Thoroughly comment your code to explain what each section is doing and why when relevant.

Comments should make the code understandable to someone unfamiliar with your work.

Use clear, concise language.

For complex logic, add more detailed explanations.

Example:

```ts
/**
 * Retrieves a user and all their published posts.
 * Use when displaying a user's public profile or content feed.
 */
import { PrismaClient } from '@prisma/client';
const prisma = new PrismaClient();

async function getUserWithPublishedPosts(userId: number) {
  // Fetch user and only their published posts (not drafts)
  return await prisma.user.findUnique({
    where: { id: userId },
    include: {
      posts: {
        where: { published: true },
      },
    },
  });
}

```
